abstract={Real-time monitoring and handling of traffic in large urban cities, remains challenging due to a broad range of technical and non-technical factors. For example, while real-time incident reporting with supporting data (e.g., images or video feeds) can inform decision-making and facilitate traffic control, there are operational challenges (e.g., bandwidth and security). Hence, we propose an identity authentication and privacy preservation scheme based on both blockchain and ring signature. Specifically, in our approach, blockchain is leveraged to maintain anonymity yet guaranteeing traceability. We also design a new ring signature scheme based on the SM2 algorithm and analyze its security. To demonstrate utility, we evaluate our proposed approach using Ethereum smart contracts, and the findings demonstrate that our approach is efficient, supports privacy preservation, and is resilient to a range of common attacks. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Nowadays, blockchain technology is one of the advanced technologies to ensure the security of users’ sensitive or confidential data. Blockchain technology plays a vital role in various applications like artificial intelligence, supply chain, cloud computing, the healthcare sector, and many more. It helps the healthcare domain to get benefitted from its many advanced features, such as confidentiality, decentralization, security, and privacy. Also, the Internet of Things (IoT) devices connect with the healthcare systems, and the healthcare sector application software further communicates with the IT industry. The blockchain-based IoT systems have significantly impacted the healthcare sector by enhancing security, privacy, transparency, and efficiency, providing better business opportunities. Moreover, traditional healthcare systems face severe security and privacy problems, such as phishing, masquerades, identity theft, and many others. Thus, a secure blockchain-based Proposed Application (PA) is designed to generate, maintain, and validate healthcare certificates. The PA acts as a communication medium between the backend blockchain network and application entities like hospitals, patients, doctors, and IoT devices to create and verify medical certificates. It also ensures various security features, namely confidentiality, authentication, and access control, using the concept of smart contracts. The comparative and performance analysis of the proposed work shows that it provides a more effective solution than the existing schemes. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={With the continuous innovative development and popularization of mobile smart devices, the application of Mobile Crowd Sensing (MCS) continues to be studied extensively. However, existing centralized MCS applications that use servers for task publishing and data collection exhibit common problems, such as single points of failure and security vulnerabilities. Accordingly, we proposed a hybrid blockchain-based identity authentication scheme for MCS called HBIA, which uses blockchain technology to resolve the single-point failure problem. HBIA builds a cluster structure based on factors such as geographical location and balance, and uses it to construct a hybrid blockchain, with the cluster head node and internal cluster node authenticating on the public and private chains, respectively. We also implemented zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) to ensure the privacy of participants’ identities, thus balancing the contradiction between blockchain transparency and security. In addition, HBIA uses the zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge (zk-SNARK) technology to enable off-chain computing and on-chain verification, further reducing the blockchain's workload. Finally,​ HBIA was evaluated based on the pavement crack detection task and tested on the Ethereum public test network known as Ropsten. The test results indicate that the identity authentication scheme proposed in this paper is superior to existing schemes in terms of authentication time. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Digitalization has made it easier for centric systems to transition from single-factor to two-factor authentication. However, several access control practices struggle to authenticate users correctly due to their weak and outdated authorization systems. Moreover, the majority of cloud-centric models suffer from security and single-point-of-failure issues. Consequently, several systems have migrated their access control services to the blockchain. A good illustration is using two-factor authentication techniques to increase transaction security in Bitcoin systems. However, with this holistic trend of 2FAs, multi-factor authentication has yet to see this trend. In this regard, the study proposes an access control technique that combines multiple factors of knowledge, inherent, and possession to authenticate users to the blockchain. The multiple factors derive a time-based access code for users to generate private keys. The efficiency of the proposed method is tested with a Py-Eth-pairing library to determine the computation cost and transmission overhead. Furthermore, we use the EIP (Ethereum Improvement Proposals) library to assess the gas cost and determine the throughput. Our findings show the suggested approach to achieving the lowest operational cost, making it scalable on the blockchain while demonstrating its practicability through the model framework. © 2023},

abstract={Electronic Commodity Trading has a pivotal role in our economic activities. In the literature, there is a classic problem called “Fair Exchange” which is fundamental to electronic commodity trading. It means the participants can receive the exchange item of the counterparty as they have agreed on before. Since the ownership of items online is often authorized by digital signatures, we focus on the problem of the fair exchange of digital signatures in this paper. As the concept of the Metaverse becomes popular recently, what we are concerned about is how the fair exchange will evolve in a metaverse. It is said that the metaverse is a vision of how the next generation of the internet will operate and the research for the fair exchange problem in it is essential for a wide range of applications like trading a (Non-fungible-token) NFT. Many cryptographic fair exchange protocols are proposed to deal with such a problem. However, most of them should rely on a Trusted Third Party (TTP) and the security is restricted by the TTP. The way the metaverse will work is still being defined. But it will probably provide users with a decentralized environment and a fair exchange protocol relying on a TTP seems unsuitable for it. Recently, researchers present some blockchain-based fair exchange protocols to get rid of or reduce the power of a TTP. But these blockchain-based protocols face new challenges. Firstly, cryptography pairing operations are often contained in such a TTP-free protocol and cost too much for the blockchain. Secondly, the player may hang for an unacceptably long time of the latency of the blockchain network. Thirdly, it is difficult to protect the privacy of the signatures while making the whole protocol verifiable at the same time. To bridge these research gaps, this paper presents a novel signature exchange protocol called DFSE which is decentralized, verifiable, efficient and autonomous. To give a real-world evaluation, we perform the experiment on the live test network of Ethereum and the results show that our protocol is feasible. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The Industrial IoT is starting an enormous advancement occasion in the industrial epoch. Data security as well as privacy becomes a challenge in almost every field in the real life for the duration of monitoring and collection of data in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) applications. The security and privacy of data in IIoT depends on the user’s reliability that can be obtained by using the user authentication scheme otherwise unable to secure the IIoT applications data. Many authors have proposed the user authentication schemes in industrial internet of things who suffer from some hindrances such as data security, throughput, single point of failure, storage problem and latency (due to which increases the eavesdropping attacks chances). Therefore, to eliminate the above security issues, this paper proposes a new hybrid authentication approach instead of that also increases the throughput of IIoT applications, reduces the latency as well as enhances the accuracy of IIoT users. To create smart contracts of user authentication approaches by using the PKI and ECC algorithms, whereas it helps to achieve the privacy preservation. Instead of that, ECC that constructs the trustworthy user authentication blockchain scheme which enhance the privacy further as well as helps to maintain the number of keys along, every time keys are updated continuously. Moreover, we implement the proposed approach on the Ethereum blockchain and put all the data through smart contract on the decentralized IPFS cloud server which is transparent, secure, traceable, and storage utilization. Only authenticated users can interface with IIoT applications, even if someone tries to corrupt them, and then revoke the digital certificate from the user. It will be known from the performance of this paper that the proposed approach not only provides the privacy of the users but also obtains the high authentication accuracy, throughput and reduces the latency in comparison of existing approach. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has captured the attention of various smart farming industries in recent years by connecting physical objects of smart farms over the internet so that they can be discovered and queried globally using Enterprise Application Software (EAS). This continuous transmission and processing poses a significant challenge in dealing with the massive amount of Big-Data being gathered and disseminated. As more applications use cloud platforms to increase storage capacity by storing Big-Data on an untrusted cloud server, data security precautions should be taken. However, with the rapid increase in the number of IIoT devices and EAS end-users and their diverse categories, the existing device authentication mechanisms in IIoT suffer from single factor authentication and poor adaptability. In light of the security requirements in IIoT Big-Data sharing using untrusted cloud servers, we present in this paper a sustainable Ethereum merge-based Big-Data gathering and dissemination in IIoT system. Extensive theoretical and simulation results validate data gathering with a business incentive mechanism with a proper data propagation threshold is an important parameter for determining equilibrium and analysing dynamic properties of IIoT system, which directly affects data processing speed and its final state. The Ethereum merge mechanism controls data dissemination instances in both the industry and EAS through classification and integrity verification using distributed authentication devices. Proof-of-stake is used for this purpose, which uses randomly selected validators to confirm transactions and add new ledgers to consortium blockchains to transfer data using partial secrets, making it fast, secure, and sustainable. Our proposed scheme outperforms other state-of-the-art schemes in simulation over Hyperledger Fabric with improved security measures. © 2023 THE AUTHORS},

abstract={In the present digital era, Personal Data Privacy is considered one of the fundamental rights in many countries, and regulation demands strict compliance with privacy laws. Patient Health Records in electronic form are highly personal and must be handled with due care and sensitivity to ensure the individual's privacy by giving full control to the patient by employing a self-sovereign model and, at the same time, protected from attacks by hackers. While blockchain technology, with its distributed ledger and immutability, promises to take care of the basic privacy and security requirements of personal digital data, there are several areas where improvements are needed in order to make this technology a robust, practical system. This paper proposes a system which introduces the privacy protection mechanisms to be applied to a blockchain-based patient records system for full privacy protection. The data is shared between different stakeholders in an encrypted format with a session key operational for a predetermined amount of time. The session keys are managed by private certificate authorization with quantum resistance NTRU algorithm. A comparative analysis of various asymmetric key cryptography algorithms indicates that Enhanced NTRU is superior in performance and provides the best security. The encrypted Electronic Health Record (EHR) is stored using Interplanetary File System (IPFS) protocol, and its hashes are recorded on the Ethereum blockchain test network. IPFS solves the issue of storing a large amount of data on the blockchain, and encryption solves the data transparency with Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) to resolve the authentication of the stakeholders. The proposed system's response time, latency, resource utilization and efficiency have been assessed experimentally for various transactions. The proposed system ensures patient confidentiality while sharing health records, making it future-proof. © 2023 Seventh Sense Research Group®},

abstract={Objectives: This paper addresses the problem of secure data storage and sharing over cloud storage infrastructures. A secure, distributed cloud storage structure incorporating the blockchain structure is proposed that supports confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Methods/Analysis: The proposed structure combines two well-known technologies: one of them is the Ethereum Blockchain and its Smart Contracts and the other is the RSA encryption and authentication scheme. The Ethereum Blockchain is used as a data structure, which ensures data availability and integrity while RSA provides sensitive data confidentiality and source authentication. Findings: As a result, users of the proposed structure can trust it and be certain that they can securely exchange information through a publicly accessible and shared cloud storage. The application can be used either through a user interface (UI) or a command-line interface (CLI). Novelty /Improvement: The novelty of this work is that the system that is proposed could be used for secure data storage on the cloud as well as for file sharing and authentication verification. Also, secure data storage and file sharing are already offered by the proposed system. © 2023 by the authors. Licensee ESJ, Italy.},

funding_text 1={From a technical point of view, the Ethereum platform itself is not a cryptocurrency. However, like other open, unauthorized blockchains, Ethereum requires a value chain within the chain to enable on-net transaction validation (i.e., a payment method for network nodes performing the operations). This is where Ethereum (ETH) cryptocurrency comes into play. Ether not only allows you to build smart contracts on the Ethereum platform (i.e., feed them), but also acts as a medium of exchange. Like Bitcoin, Ethereum currently uses a PoW (Proof of Work) consent mechanism but is slowly moving towards a PoS (Proof of Stake) consent mechanism, known as the Casper protocol. The development of Ethereum is promoted and supported by the Ethereum Foundation, a Swiss non-profit organization founded by the inventors of Ethereum. A large volume of Ethereum was "pre-mined" (i.e., mined / created before the official release of the currency to the public) by its inventors and sold in large numbers to pay for development costs and to fund the Ethereum Foundation. Just like Bitcoin, Ethereum is a prime example of an open, unauthorized Blockchain. Anyone can join or leave the Ethereum network at will without having to be pre-approved by any central entity, and like Bitcoin, Ethereum (ETH) can be categorized as a pseudo-anonymous currency).},

abstract={The last few years have witnessed exponential rise in online digital data for real-time communication, storage, and query-driven processing. It has broadened the horizon for decentralized and ad-hoc digital data used for swift decision making. Nowadays, Electronic healthcare (e-Healthcare) is one of the most demanding industries for telemedicine and Electronic Healthcare Record (EHR) communication purposes. However, ensuring data-security over uncertain channels has remained challenge. To alleviate data-security challenges and enable preserved and immutable data exchange, blockchain technology has been found potential. Despite such significances, most of the existing EHR -oriented blockchain frameworks are developed permissionless with hospital as central unit with almost all access rights. This as a result has demotivated patients due to private data breaches and fake-insurance claims. Considering this limitation developing a patient-centric secure blockchain framework was inevitable. Recently, securing EHR data is a hot research topic and the existing works used varied schemes to enhance the security and privacy of EHR with minimum cost. But the existing studies faces several critical issues like computational complexity, higher processing time, data leakage, sensitive to different attacks, scalability problem etc. The aforementioned issues in the existing studies leads the system as reduced confidentiality and data insecurity. Thus, to overcome such issues, this paper proposes a highly robust pre-transaction signature verification assisted patient-centric multi-stakeholder blockchain model. The proposed blockchain framework focused on multi-stakeholder scalability as well as interoperability aspects while guaranteeing attack-resilience. It was designed over Ethereum armored with blockchain manager (BCM) and smart contract components, where cloud-based interplanetary file system was developed to support decentralized data-storage. It employed a gateway component to perform user’s signature verification to thwart away intruders. Once verifying the signature, BCM triggers user’s request to the smart contract that verifies user details and allied role, right and access (RRA) policies. In sync with RRA policies for the requesting node, BCM allows user (patients and doctors) to perform data upload, view and sharing. To share the patient data, the proposed method triggers a signature request phase in which the doctor requests intended patient for signature and receiving the signature-acknowledgement it performs unabstracted data view and sharing and alleviates any probability of single-point-failure. The proposed blockchain framework provides a unified solution with improved flexibility, availability, decentralized access, identity management, user authentication, patient centric permissioned control and data security that makes it suitable for real-time purposes. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The utilization of Internet of Things (IoT) devices in various smart city and industrial applications is growing rapidly. Within a trusted authority (TA), such as an industry or smart city, all IoT devices are closely monitored in a controlled infrastructure. However, in cases where an IoT device from one TA needs to communicate with another IoT device from a different TA, the trust establishment between these devices becomes extremely important. Obtaining a digital certificate from a certificate authority for each IoT device can be expensive. To solve this issue, a group authentication framework is proposed that can establish trust between group IoT devices owned by different entities. The Chebyshev polynomial has many important properties, semigroup is one of the most important. These properties make the Chebyshev polynomial a good candidate for the proposed group authentication mechanism. The secure exchange of information between trusted authorities is supported by Blockchain technology. The proposed framework was implemented and tested using Python and deployed on Blockchain using Ethereum’s Goerli’s testnet. The results show that the proposed framework can reasonably use Chebyshev polynomials with degrees up to four digits in length. The values of various parameters related to Blockchain are also discussed to understand the usability of the proposed framework. © 2023 by the authors.},

abstract={Anonymous yet accountable authentication can protect users' privacy and security and prevent users from misbehaving when they access public Wi-Fi hotspots. However, most existing privacy-enhanced authentication schemes either do not meet the accountability requirements in public Wi-Fi hotspot access or they are inherently dependent on trusted third parties, and therefore are undeployable in practical settings. In this paper, we design and implement an access authentication scheme to simultaneously and efficiently provide anonymity and accountability without relying on any trusted third party by utilizing a permissionless blockchain (e.g., Bitcoin or Ethereum) and Intel SGX. Inspired by the recent progress on Bitcoin techniques such as Colored Coins, we utilize the unmodified Bitcoin blockchain as the powerful platform to manage access credentials without introducing any trusted third party. We leverage SGX-based mixer to allow users to anonymously exchange their access credentials and design the verification path of access credentials to support blacklisting misbehaving access credentials without compromising users' anonymity. By integrating with the anti-double-spending property of the Bitcoin blockchain, our scheme can simultaneously provide users' accountability and anonymity without involving any trusted third party. Finally, we demonstrate that our proposed scheme is compatible with the current Bitcoin system or other permissionless blockchains, and is highly effective and practical for public Wi-Fi hotspot access control systems. © 1967-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Drone-based systems supporting Search and Rescue (SAR) missions help expeditiously improve the possibility of discovering the missing victims. Nonetheless, the current drone-based systems have some limitations, such as the need for humans in control of large-scale drones, drone's energy inefficiency, repercussion of quality of service (QoS) from abnormalities events, shortages of automaticity and real-time interactions, deficiency of swift decisions from artificial intelligence-based SAR, and underestimation of security issues in SAR systems. Therefore, developing a more advanced drone-based system is necessary to overcome these limitations. However, it is challenging to achieve the target due to trade-off relationships of technologies and strict requirements of time-critical SAR. This paper studies the feasibility of an Internet-of-Drones (IoD) system using blockchain and artificial intelligence at the edge to overcome limitations and improve SAR QoS. An advanced IoD system architecture from drones to a back-end system and end-users terminals has been proposed. Furthermore, advanced edge services and artificial intelligence at the edge have been presented for automatically searching for missing persons. In addition, computation offloading approaches have been provided to improve the energy efficiency of drones and reduce system latency. Last but not least, public and private blockchain, including Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric, for providing secure and decentralized healthcare platform has been investigated and analyzed to enable real-time interaction between healthcare entities and improves healthcare services. The results show that the proposed system helps overcome the limitations and improve the SAR QoS. Besides, the proposed system satisfies the security requirements, including confidentiality, integrity, authentication, authorization, access control, privacy, trust, transparency, availability, automaticity, and tolerance. © 2022 The Author(s)},

abstract={With the ongoing revolutionary growth of the industrial Internet of Things and smart grid networks, smart grid (SG) communication has been acknowledged as a next-generation network for intelligent and efficient electric power transmission. In SG networks, smart meters (SMs) generally send requests for electricity demand to service providers (SPs), which deal with the requests for efficient energy distribution. However, SGs experience many security issues with the deployed SMs and untrusted wireless communication. To tackle these security issues, we propose a privacy-preserving authentication scheme for demand response management in SGs, called BPPS. It can resist various attacks and achieve secure mutual authentication with key agreement; moreover, it provides integrity of demand-response data using blockchain. Moreover, we perform the informal and formal (mathematical) security analysis to confirm that BPPS is secure against various attacks and achieves session key security, respectively. Furthermore, we conduct the performance and simulation analysis for SGs using NS3 and Ethereum testnet.

abstract={Internet-of-Things enables interconnection of billions of devices, which perform autonomous operations and collect various types of data. These things, along with their generated huge amount of data, need to be handled efficiently and securely. Centralized solutions are not desired due to security concerns and scalability issue. In this article, we propose HIBEChain, a hierarchical blockchain system that realizes scalable and accountable management of IoT devices and data. HIBEChain consists of multiple permissioned blockchains that form a hierarchical tree structure. To support the hierarchical structure of HIBEChain, we design a decentralized hierarchical identity-based signature (DHIBS) scheme, which enables IoT devices to use their identities as public keys. Consequently, HIBEChain achieves high scalability through parallel processing as blockchain sharding schemes, and it also implements accountability by use of identity-based keys. Identity-based keys not only make HIBEChain more user-friendly, they also allow private key recovery by validators when necessary. We provide detailed analysis of its security and performance, and implement HIBEChain based on Ethereum source code. Experiment results show that a 6-ary, (7,10)-threshold, 4-level HIBEChain can achieve 32,000 TPS, and it needs only 9 seconds to confirm a transaction. © 2004-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Designing a secure and efficient authentication protocol is crucial and challenging in the mobility network. Due to the seamless roaming of mobile users over multiple foreign agents and the broadcast nature of the communication channel, the mobile networks are often exposed to several network attacks. To achieve perfect authentication and secure communication among mobility entities like MU (Mobile User), FA (Foreign Agent) and HA (Home Agent), the researchers have proposed numerous authentication protocols in the past. However, the existing protocols for the mobility environments are insufficient to address the fundamental security concerns and an adversary can impersonate the mobile user at anytime. Thus, we propose Mobile-Chain, a secure blockchain-based authentication system for mobility environments. The proposed Mobile-Chain is designed to protect user privacy and guarantees provable security like authentication, anonymity, untraceability, confidentiality, data integrity, and decentralization. The implementation of the security framework has been done on the ethereum blockchain platform using smart contracts written in a solidity programming language. The security analysis reveals that Mobile-Chain is robust against various security threats to which mobility networks are vulnerable. Besides, the authentication framework has been measured through a formal security verification tool known as Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocol and Application (AVISPA). Notably, the performance evaluation of the proposed protocol proves that it maintains performance gain, computationally efficient, and implementable in resource-limited wireless and mobility environments. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Over the past decade, there has been significant evolution in the security field, specifically in the authentication and authorization part. The standard authentication protocol nowadays is OAuth 2.0-based authentication. This method relies on a third-party authentication service provider with complete control over the users’ data, which it can filter or modify at will. Blockchain and decentralization have generated much interest in recent years, and the decentralized web is considered the next significant improvement in the world wide web (also known as Web 3.0). Web3 authentication, also known as decentralized authentication, allows for the secure and decentralized authentication of users on the web. The use cases for this technology include online marketplaces, social media platforms, and other online communities that require user authentication. The advantages of Web3 authentication include increased security and privacy for users and the ability for users to have more control over their data. The proposed system implementation uses Ethereum as the blockchain and a modern web stack to enhance user interaction and usability. The solution brings benefits both to the private and the public sector, proving that it has the capability of becoming the preferred authentication mechanism for any decentralized web application. © 2023 by the authors.},

abstract={The threat of cyber-attacks is ever increasing in today’s society. There is a clear need for better and more effective defensive tools. Intrusion detection can be defined as the detection of anomalous behavior either in the host or in the network. An intrusion detection system can be used to identify the anomalous behavior of the system. The two major tasks of intrusion detection are to monitor data and raise an alert to the system administrators when an intrusion takes place. The current intrusion detection system is incapable of tackling sophisticated attacks which take place on the entire network containing large number of nodes while maintaining a low number of login attempts on each node in the system. A collaborative intrusion detection system (CIDS) was designed to remove the inefficiency of the current intrusion detection system which failed to detect coordinated distributed attacks. The main problem in the CIDS is the concept of trust. Hosts in the network need to trust the data sent by other peers in the network. To bring in the concept of trust and implement the proof-of-concept, blockchain was used. Pluggable authentication modules (PAM) were also used to track login activity securely before an intruder could modify the login activity. To implement blockchain, an Ethereum-based private blockchain was used. © 2023 by the authors.},

abstract={With the rapid increase in the number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices in recent years, massive amounts of sensitive IoT data are being generated and transmitted over the Internet. Despite its growing adoption in various fields, IoT security remains a major challenge requiring further research. IoT authentication is an essential security mechanism for building trust in IoT systems. However, conventional authentication approaches use expensive cryptographic primitives that do not align with the resource-constrained nature of IoT devices. Furthermore, centralized authentication schemes have proven to be inapplicable for cross-domain authentication and do not limit the scalability of IoT networks. Recently, blockchain technology has been applied to building decentralized authentication between IoT devices. Nevertheless, most existing blockchain-based authentication approaches incur high overhead in IoT computation, storage, and energy consumption. Authentication time is another critical issue in real-time IoT systems. When numerous IoT authentication requests are transferred to the blockchain, an additional time delay is imposed, in addition to the high computational cost of the blockchain caused by the consensus mechanism. This study proposes a hybrid centralized and blockchain-based authentication architecture for IoT systems. Edge servers are deployed to provide centralized authentication for associated IoT devices. A blockchain network of centralized edge servers is then established to ensure decentralized authentication and verification of IoT devices that belong to different and heterogeneous IoT systems. Lightweight cryptographic methods are implemented to achieve efficient authentication, in which limiting the consumption of IoT resources is required. The architecture is demonstrated using a local Ethereum blockchain network. The results indicate that the proposed method achieves significant improvements in terms of computation cost, execution time, and power consumption for IoT compared with centralized and blockchain-based authentication schemes. A security analysis proves the ability of our architecture to mitigate attacks and satisfy the IoT security requirements. © 2023 The Author(s)},

abstract={Internet-of-Things (IoT) are increasingly operating in the zero-Trust environments where any devices and systems may be compromised and hence untrusted. In addition, data collected by and sent from IoT devices may be shared with and processed by edge computing systems, in order to reduce the reliance on centralized (cloud) servers, leading to further security and privacy issues. To cope with these challenges, this paper proposes an innovative blockchain-enabled information sharing solution in zero-Trust context to guarantee anonymity yet entity authentication, data privacy yet data trustworthiness, and participant stimulation yet fairness. This new solution is able to support filtering of fabricated information through smart contracts, effective voting, and consensus mechanisms, which can prevent unauthenticated participants from sharing garbage information. We also prove that the proposed solution is secure in the universal composability framework, and further evaluate its performance over an Ethereum-based blockchain platform to demonstrate its utility. © 1968-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Confidentiality, availability, integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation when together became the top priority for secure communication. However, authentication is the first line of defense in all these security parameters. Unfortunately, several authentication mechanisms in the traditional methods cannot provide secure communication due to various vulnerabilities such as single point of failure and privacy issues. Furthermore, key distribution mechanisms such as Certificate Authority (CA) and Trusted Third Party (TTP) distribute keys over the central architecture fail, thus secure communication cannot occur. As a solution to these drawbacks, this paper proposes a new decentralized blockchain-based identity authentication mechanism for VoIP networks, VoIPChain. The proposed scheme utilizes the main features of the blockchain platform, such as immutability, transparency, and fault tolerance, to provide data privacy and secure communication in VoIP applications. The proposed scheme is evaluated as an actual implementation using the virtual Ethereum platform and Python language. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme is an efficient and cost-effective solution for the call process as a decentralized identity authentication system in VoIP. In addition, end-to-end secure call performance outperforms the existing blockchain-based authentication mechanisms by 30%–70% in terms of average time delay. The proposed scheme is almost ten times faster than the TLS process to authenticate between parties. Moreover, compared to fast but less secure basic methods over the SIP authentication the proposed scheme has an acceptable time delay in a call process. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Blockchain-based supply chains provide a new solution to decentralized multi-party product management. However, existing methods, including ID-based and cryptographic-based solutions, cannot achieve both counterfeit resistance and decentralization in supply chain management. We argue that this dilemma comes from the disconnection and inconsistency of the data records and physical product entities. This paper proposes RF-Chain, a novel decentralized supply chain management solution that uniquely combines data record authentication and physical-layer RFID tag authentication to effectively achieve credibility and counterfeit resistance. The main contribution of this work is to integrate physical-layer authentication of cheap commodity RFID tags into a blockchain-based information management system, and RF-Chain is the first to do so. The proposed cross-layer authentication can effectively defend against counterfeit attacks without relying on a central key management service. Real-world experiments utilizing the Ethereum (ETH) platform and more than 100 RFID tags demonstrate that RF-Chain is secure, effective, time-efficient, and cost-efficient. © 2023 ACM.},

abstract={There has been an increase in the adoption of mobile payment systems worldwide in the past few years. However, poor Internet connection in rural regions continues to be an obstacle to the widespread use of such technologies. On top of that, there are significant problems with the currently available offline wallets; for instance, the payee cannot verify the number of coins received without access to the Internet. Additionally, it has been demonstrated that some existing systems are susceptible to false token generation, and some do not even permit the user to divide the offline token into smaller portions to be used as change. This paper proposes a blockchain-based wallet system that provides a secure mobile payment service even if a user cannot access a reliable Internet connection. Our approach relies on Bluetooth and digital signatures to establish and build a trust connection between the parties. The proposed solution overcomes the main limitations of existing systems that use offline transactions, such as the generation of fake offline tokens and the indivisibility of offline tokens. The user buys Offline Tokens (OTs) from a server called an Offline Token Manager (OTM) to use them later to perform offline transactions. Each mobile device must store a single, signed offline token transaction to prevent fake tokens. On the other hand, all offline transactions will be kept as a history in a particular local database. Finally, when the receiver becomes online, it will send a convert request to the OTM to change the value of the OTs to the appropriate amount in real coins. This step requires a connection to the Internet. To evaluate the effectiveness of the system, the Solidity programming language was used to develop a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain with a backend application programming interface (API) and an android mobile application. The proposed method has an advantage over other prominent wallets. © 2023 Tech Science Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Recently, blockchain technology has become popular. Through a highly secure, decentralised system enabled by this technology, anyone can interact securely without the need for a middleman. Machine learning can help with many of the constraints that blockchain-based systems have in addition to its own strengths. Blockchain technology and machine learning together have the potential to produce very effective and beneficial outcomes. Hence, when blockchain and ML converge, they surely would benefit from each other. Blockchain can enhance the security of ML platforms, and ML can provide automation and optimization to blockchain solutions. In this work, we advocate the importance of enhancing blockchain with ML algorithms, as a proof of principle we address the issue of secure and intelligent e-voting. The use of blockchain technology has brought tremendous different application domains, e-voting is one of them. Most existing e-Voting systems require central authority during the process of authentication and verification of the voter. In this paper, we propose a safe online voting approach based on blockchain and ML to provide a solution to this issue. We use blockchain to ensure integrity and transparency of the votes, and ML for automating the verification process of eligible voters based on AI-for face authentication. The proposed solution offers automation, security, and mobility to the voting system. © 2023 IEEE.},

abstract={Service providers are separated in a traditional Internet environment. In various scenarios，people have to register a large number of accounts to use application services，which leads to uncontrollable information leakage risks and complicated information update processes. Many Decentralized Identity（DID）authentication mechanisms have been proposed to break down the barriers around isolated digital identities to give users greater control over their private data. However，existing approaches burden users with the management of private keys and presume spontaneous availability of a credential-issuance ecosystem. This study proposes a decentralized digital identity authentication scheme based on smart contracts and non-fungible tokens. It elaborates on the concepts of digital identities and accounts，and illustrates their differences and associations. Hierarchical deterministic wallet technology is applied to generate and manage cryptographic key pairs as digital identities and digital accounts which are stored on a blockchain as Non-Fungible Tokens（NFT）. Moreover，zero-knowledge proofs are incorporated to protect personal information. Traditional trusted third parties are replaced with smart contracts on the blockchain to achieve Single Sign-On（SSO）mechanism， which enables "authentication once，login everywhere" and is compatible with legacy web accounts. The proposed scheme was then tested on a private Ethereum blockchain. The experimental results show that the scheme implements SSO in a decentralized method and satisfies the requirements of availability，anonymity，and security. © 2023, Editorial Office of Computer Engineering.

abstract={Industrial wireless sensor networks (IWSNs) are indispensable for Industry 4.0. However, limited to the resource of sensor nodes, designing an effective and secure authentication protocol for real-time data access in IWSNs is full of challenges. In addition, existing protocols fail to balance security and performance for real-time access to IWSNs simultaneously. Thus, we design an efficient authentication key agreement protocol using the physical unclonable function (PUF), elliptic curve cryptography (ECC), and smart contract. We perform formal security analysis under the random oracle model and demonstrate that our protocol meets the basic requirements. Rinkeby, an online Ethereum test network, is used to test the smart contract. Finally, we evaluate computation, communication and storage costs with several similar protocols. The results show that our protocol can provide a higher level of security and the lowest storage cost. © 2023 IEEE.},

abstract={Traditional methods of document storage have cre-ated validity and safety issues for academic, professional, and other certifications. To alleviate these issues, many researchers use the blockchain to justify those documents' authenticity. Getting these certificates from different providers, putting them in order, and then applying for a job can take time and effort. This study developed heterogeneous interoperability by which all applicants are linked to this system and can list their certificates deployed on various blockchain networks. When a recruiter posts a job, the applicant can make a CV by choosing the needed certifications. After submitting a CV, the selected certificates will be transferred from the provider blockchain to our system for a limited time through interoperability and provide access to the recruiter. A recruiter can check the files by clicking on a candidate's CV to evaluate the authenticity of the certificates. We developed our system using Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum to perform interoperability, but it is also generalizable to other programmable blockchain networks like IOTA, Quorum, Hyperledger Beau, etc. © 2023 IEEE.},

abstract={The proliferation of the internet of things (IoT) within the emergence of five-generation (5G) networks has received a huge attention in both industrial and academic domains. A 5G network is a cornerstone of realizing the full potential of the IoT, which interconnects billions of devices wirelessly. However, wireless communication in IoT devices reveals tremendous security risks in different dimensions and precisely in the distribution of the user certificates. The existing X.509 PKI, or the proposed decentralized PKI based on blockchain solutions have lacked practicality, and continue to have security flaws, or have not yet gained widespread acceptance owing to complexity and deployment issues. We present a lightweight certificate in size (LightCert4IoTs) that is not issued by Certification Authorities (CAs) due to the cost and complexity of the assignment of a signed certificate. In LightCert4IoTs first, an end-user (i.e., mobile and IoT devices) issues a self-signed certificate and lets Local Registration Authorities (LRAs)/EDGE nodes to verify and validate the binding identity-self signed certificate of the users through the Ethereum blockchain where The Ethereum network is used as the global notary for the IoT light certificates by saving them in the blockchain immutable ledger. The LightCert4IoTs leverages the advantages of blockchain technology and smart contracts to address the existing challenges of PKI certificates in IoT devices, which neatly achieve certificate issuance, update, and revocation more securely and efficiently. Finally, the LightCert4IoTs experimental results show that LightCert, as compared to relevant solutions/baselines, achieves reasonable overheads and is suitable for use in low-constrained IoT devices where the memory and processor power are optimized. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={In the current global marketplace supply chains can span a huge number of countries, cross many borders and require interoperation of a multitude of organizations. This vastness of supply chains impacts business competitiveness since it adds complexity and can difficult securing traceability, chain of custody and transparency. We propose that assuring chain of custody and traceability via Blockchain (BC) allows organizations to demonstrate product provenance, integrity and compliance. This work proposes that to effect true traceability the more complete approach is to connect both the Supply Chain Actors (SCAs) and products identifications using digital certificates. A Blockchain is used to manage the traceability of products and validation of the identities. Importing, verifying and storing the certificates uses an off-chain data storage solution for products certificates, IDs and data (i.e., WalliD). To create, validate the certificates and setup the chain of trust a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) was designed as part of the proposal. Our study follows a Design Science research approach aimed to analyse the requirements and propose a solution to a more complete traceability in supply chains. The results were architectural artifacts, including an Ethereum Smart Contract and a PKI based certificate authentication system. The implementation of these deliverables allow for a supply chain system that can provide decentralized and trustful assurance of the provenance, chain of custody and traceability functionalities for all the Organizations and also for the final consumers. To exemplify the problem and demonstrate the applicability of the solution, its potential and benefits we applied it to a real food supply chain use case that already uses provenance certificates and stored them in the blockchain using the before mentioned SmartContract to assure and demonstrate the chain of custody and traceability of the food produce. © 2023, The Author(s).},

abstract={The next generation of mobile communication systems must be secured because of the ongoing entrance of numerous security attacks. Thus, to secure the underlying network, the 3GPP has designed an authentication and key agreement protocol, 5G-AKA, to safely and stably access the mobile services. However, some recent observations indicate that 5G-AKA has numerous shortcomings such as perfect forward secrecy violation, malicious Serving Network (SN), de-synchronization attack, privacy theft, stolen device, and denial of Service (DoS) attacks when the user uses the roaming mobile services. Considering the shortcomings of existing protocols and the requirement to offer increased security, we propose a provable secure, efficient 5G-AKA authentication protocol using the blockchain. The security features of the proposed protocol are examined using the Real-Or-Random (ROR) logic and Scyther tool. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed protocol is evaluated, which shows that it is the least costly compared to its counterparts in terms of computational and communication costs. In addition, the comparison of the Ethereum blockchain depicts that the proposed protocol takes less transaction and execution costs compared to its counterparts. © 2023 IEEE.},

abstract={We propose an pseudo-anonymous e-voting platform based on the blockchain of Ethereum and a coin-mixer, that is Tornado Cash. After an online authentication and authorization phase, the user receives a fungible (i.e., pseudo-anonymous) voting token that can be deposited to a coin pool belonging to Tornado Cash (TC), together with an amount of Ether (ETH) A that will be used to pay successive fees. TC uses a smart contract that accepts token deposits that can be later withdrawn by a different address. In order to preserve privacy, a relayer contract can then be used to withdraw to a fresh ETH address (thus pseudo-anonymous) using A to pay fees. Relayers solve “fee payment dilemma”, that is paying withdrawal fees by maintaining pseudo-anonymity. Finally, a further smart contract collects preferences and, after the closure of the elections, it automatically performs the counting of votes. All the front-end has been developed in a Web browser, by using Javascript and avoiding the voter to perform any command-line operation to prepare transactions. © 2023, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={In the past decades, people had to carry a bunch of documents for acquiring citizen beneficiary services such as opening a bank account, issue of a new sim card, new gas connection, Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana etc. In this digital era, Aadhaar is acting as the driving force to gain all citizen services. Unfortunately, lot of security breaches have occurred by compromising the Aadhaar details which are stored in the database. Providing security to Aadhaar data and mitigating the misuse of other’s Aadhaar data to gain citizen services by unauthenticated users is the main concern. Hence, a secure and authenticated system is required to store and use the Aadhaar details securely by authenticated users. In this paper, we are proposing a secure authenticated system which uses IPFS to store fingerprints of the customers and blockchain is used to store the Aadhaar details of the registered citizens. In this system, the biometric is integrated with blockchain to secure Aadhaar details and authenticate the customers before providing any citizen services. The system also generates the Aadhaar card after passing a redundancy check for customers who do not have Aadhaar card to access the citizen services. The system is tested and verified for multiple citizen services. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Smart home devices are vulnerable to a variety of attacks. The matter gets more complicated when a number of devices collaborate to launch a colluding attack (e.g., Distributed-Denial-of-Service (DDoS)) in a network (e.g., Smart home). To handle these attacks, most studies have hitherto proposed authentication protocols that cannot necessarily be implemented in devices, especially during Device-to-Device (D2D) interactions. Tapping into the potential of Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts, this work proposes a lightweight authentication mechanism that enables safe D2D interactions in a smart home. The Ethereum blockchain enables the implementation of a decentralized prototype as well as a peer-to-peer distributed ledger system. The work also uses a single server queuing system model and the authentication mechanism to curtail DDoS attacks by controlling the number of service requests in the system. The simulation was conducted twenty times, each with varying number of devices chosen at random (ranging from 1 to 30). Each requester device sends an arbitrary request with a unique resource requirement at a time. This is done to measure the system's consistency across a variety of device capabilities. The experimental results show that the proposed protocol not only prevents colluding attacks, but also outperforms the benchmark protocols in terms of computational cost, message processing, and response times. © 2023 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) has proved its applicability in numerous domains, such as healthcare, agriculture, automobile, industrial production, logistics, and supply chain management. Looking at the current trend, we expect a massive proliferation of such IoT devices all around us. However, one of the issues with the widespread use of IoT is the increasing complexity of the underlying architecture, which leads to difficulty in ensuring security compliance. Key refreshment, one of the critical aspects of key management, requires a regular update of the key used to provide strong security. However, in most cases, keys are not updated. If they are updated, the update logs (e.g., time of last key update) are not available for all entities to verify and establish trust in the system. Moreover, the rules for key refreshment are also not defined transparently. In this direction, the present work proposes a blockchain-regulated, secure, verifiable, and automatic key refreshment mechanism for IoT systems. The proposed mechanism enables users to verify the freshness of the security keys (being used), thereby relying on the data from IoT devices and establishing trust in an IoT system. The proposed mechanism is driven by blockchain technology and smart contract. As proof of concept, we have implemented the proposed solution using Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric blockchains. Cost, scalability, and security (formal and informal) analyses have been carried out for performance analysis. The results show the economic viability and strong security of the proposed mechanism. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of a secure sensing data processing and logging system. The system is inspired and enabled by the blockchain technology. In this system, a public blockchain is used as immutable datastore to log the most critical data needed to secure the system. Furthermore, several innovative blockchain-inspired mechanisms have been incorporated into the system to provide additional security for the system's operations. The first priority in securing sensing data processing and logging is admission control, i.e., only legitimate sensing data are accepted for processing and logging. This is achieved via a sensor identification and authentication mechanism. The second priority is to ensure that the logged data remain intact overtime. This is achieved by storing a small amount of data condensed from the raw sensing data on a public blockchain. A Merkel-tree based mechanism is devised to link the raw sensing data stored off-chain to the condensed data placed on public blockchain. This mechanism passes the data immutability property of a public blockchain to the raw sensing data stored off-chain. Third, the raw sensing data stored off-chain are secured with a self-protection mechanism where the raw sensing data are grouped into chained blocks with a moderate amount of proof-of-work. This scheme prevents an adversary from making arbitrary changes to the logged data within a short period of time. Fourth, mechanisms are developed to facilitate the search of the condensed data placed on the public blockchain and the verification of the raw sensing data using the condensed data placed on the public blockchain. The system is implemented in Python except the graphical user interface, which is developed using C#. The functionality and feasibility of the system have been evaluated locally and with two public blockchain systems, one is the IOTA Shimmer test network, and the other is Ethereum. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={The growth of IoT devices is so rapid that several billions of such devices would be in use in a span of four-year period. Essential security mechanisms need to be put in place to curb several security attacks prevalent in IoT. Access control is an important security mechanism that ensures legitimate and controlled access to critical and limited resources in IoT. The current access control schemes for IoT could not handle burgeoning number of IoT devices, while meeting the necessary level of security. Consequently, in this paper, we propose a new scalable and secure access control scheme for IoT. With blockchain as the root-of-trust, the proposed scheme performs access control for the IoT devices without having the resource-constrained IoT devices to be part of the blockchain network and to possess substantial amount of blockchain data. Blockchain&#x2019;s tamper-proof property makes it an ideal candidate to be chosen as the root-of-trust. The scheme is secure against various security attacks prevalent in IoT. A proof-of-concept implementation for the scheme is developed and deployed in Ethereum Mainnet. The transaction costs of the different operations in the scheme are fairly below USD 3. Furthermore, scalability of the proposed scheme in different scenarios is investigated. IEEE},

abstract={Cloud-based storage of electronic health data always poses a security risk. Medical malpractices (e.g., misdiagnosis and delayed diagnosis) can be hidden if intruders remove or modify a patient’s electronic health record (HER). It requires a new design framework to address the security problems. Data storage can be secured using the blockchain, a novel technology replacing the present HER system with a reduced installation cost. This paper presents a novel framework using a blockchain-based electronic medical record management cloud system that have ensured the high security network. To integrate a wrapper layer for correct authentication on the blockchain server database. To simulate the Ethereum network and interface with the Ethereum platform to build a prototype to test the concept’s practicality.

abstract={Owing to the spread of COVID-19, the digitalization of various services is rapidly being promoted. In particular, online services such as obtaining a digital certificate (e.g., digital signature) from an authority are becoming increasingly important. Therefore, systems that can autonomously generate digital signatures are urgently required. However, the autonomous generation of signatures is difficult because the secret key for signatures must be strictly managed. Moreover, a decentralized autonomous systems should be publicly verifiable. Thus, schemes that preclude strict control of the secret key are desirable. In this study, we propose a new decentralized scheme that autonomously generates a digital signature without a secret key, using blockchain-based smart contracts. The fundamental concept behind our scheme is to eliminate secret keys by leveraging the closed nature of the processing operations of smart contracts within the blockchain; thus, the process of generating signatures and their output values satisfies the condition of immutability. Finally, we perform a security evaluation and feasibility study of our proposed scheme and show that it works securely on the Ethereum blockchain. © 2023 IEEE.},

abstract={Intelligent transportation systems with Vehicle to Everything (V2X) connectivity can help smart cities solve problems like pedestrian jaywalking, vehicle collision, and traffic congestion. V2X offers seamless connectivity between road in-frastructures and driver assistance systems with crowd-sourced data to guide design and feature sets. V2X applications raise security and privacy risks despite their benefits. Risks include data loss, device failure, and environmental damage. The current PKI-based V2X ecosystem requires many pseudonym keys to work successfully. Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) often encoun-ters bottlenecks due to the enormous volume of authorisation, registration, and confirmation requests. When we transit to a means of fully autonomous transport, an enormous amount of data related to vehicle movement will flood the V2X network. A considerable infrastructure setup is needed to validate these mes-sages. Blockchain technology offers distributed ledger technology and a decentralised data processing mechanism. So blockchain can solve the issue of validating the messages in the V2X network. This paper proposes Smartverse, a blockchain technology-based authentication method to validate messages in the V2X ecosystem. We used the Ethereum blockchain platform, Interplanatary File System (IPFS) and developed algorithms to validate the crowd-sourced data in the V2X network. When a user submits data, say vehicle collision, other users in the V2X network validate the data by a voting mechanism. Once the messages are marked valid, other V2X users will receive this message. This paper explains the blockchain-based V2X network architecture and message validation algorithm. © 2023 IEEE.},

abstract={The authenticity, traceability, and management of expensive food products require trusted, secure, and transparent end-to-end data provenance and transactions. In today's systems, transactions and data related to managing and tracing the origins and history of food products are typically stored in segregated data repositories, and controlled and managed by centralized entities, with no access or visibility to the public or key stakeholders. This increases the risk of data loss, alteration, and tampering. Further it erodes trust among all stakeholders, and weakens consumer sentiment and confidence in the expensive food market, and raises concerns about the verifiability and authenticity of expensive food products. To overcome this problem, this paper addresses the lack of traceability and authenticity problems in expensive food products utilizing blockchain technology and NFTs. NFTs are blockchain-based tokens that can be utilized to represent ownership of unique assets. We propose an NFT-based solution for expensive food products trading management, where the ownership of a food product is maintained by using digital certification, and the trading process is facilitated by smart contracts. We utilize composable NFTs for food products, where interrelated products, such as raw materials, packaged products, and Lots, are represented as top-down and bottom-up composable NFTs in the form of parent-child relationship. Composable NFTs embed extra utility within NFTs, especially when subsets of NFTs are needed. We integrate the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) decentralized storage into our solution to avoid storing large files on the blockchain while maintaining their permanency and immutability. We present various diagrams to show the system elements and the interactions among them. We illustrate algorithms along with the solution implementation details. We evaluate our solution by conducting cost and security analyses. We make our smart contracts code publicly available on GitHub. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) has altered the world in the last few years due to its capacity to impact almost every part of life. However, IoT raises concerns about data security and privacy because it collects data from devices via the cloud, increasing its vulnerability to hacking. IoT security is a serious issue that has delayed its widespread adoption. Several security and privacy solutions have been proposed for IoT contexts that meet prevalent security criteria such as authentication, integrity, and secrecy. However, due to resource restrictions and heterogeneous IoT devices, present solutions are unable to address the security requirements of the approaching large-scale IoT paradigm. Blockchain, well known for bitcoin and Ethereum, provides an intriguing approach for IoT security. The IoT and blockchain technologies may be combined and significant improvements in distributed systems have been made as a result of the widespread use of IoT technology. A novel framework with a unique design was proposed to improve security in bitcoin transaction by combining blockchain and SHA-256 hash algorithm. Additionally, the performance of proposed framework is compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms like MD5 and SHA1 in term of encryption time, power consumption, latency, speed and security. It is observed that the proposed framework takes 12 ms lesser latency than MD5 and consumes 2.7Wh lesser power consumption than SHA1 and provides better security than both the techniques. © 2023 - IOS Press.

abstract={Traffic route management is essential for reducing traffic jams and enhancing driving safety becauese of the growing number of vehicles and frequent occurrence of traffic accidents. However, in vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs), real-time messages are transmitted via wireless channels, which can result in security and privacy concerns. Existing proposals for traffic route management exist security vulnerabilities, as well as high calculation and communication costs. Encouraged by this fact, we design a lightweight traffic route management scheme for fog-based VANETs. In this scheme, vehicles utilize homomorphic encryption to encrypt their driving routes and then send the encrypted information to a fog node. The traffic management center (TMC) decrypts the received ciphertexts that are aggregated by the fog node and performs traffic management according to the decrypted data, without knowing individual route of each vehicle. Furthermore, blockchain is used in the scheme to conduct public keys management of vehicles. Our detailed security proof and analysis indicate that our proposal can meet the security objectives of VANETs. Further, to demonstrate the feasibility of the scheme, we also implement it in the Ethereum test network (i.e.,Rinkeby). Significantly, the performance analysis demonstrates that our proposal achieves a better performance than other relevant representative schemes. IEEE},

abstract={Cloud computing (CC) has become one of the prominent technologies because of the significant utility services, which focus on outsourcing data to companies and individual clients. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) can be considered an effective solution to achieve security in the cloud computing environment. Blockchain and intrusion detection can be integrated to accomplish security and privacy in the cloud infrastructure. This research develops a new fuzzy deep neural network (FDNN) with Honey Bader Algorithm (HBA) for privacy-preserving intrusion detection technique, named FDNN-HBAID for cloud environment. The presented FDNN-HBAID system is based on the design of an intrusion detection approach with a blockchain-enabled privacy-preserving scheme. An effective training strategy with the FDNN model is applied for intrusion detection and classification. Moreover, FDNN-HBAID provides maximal-security resistance to alleviate zero-day vulnerability and guarantees integrity throughout the nodes and data confidentiality and authentication. In addition, the training process of the FDNN model is carried out using the HBA for optimal adjustment of the hyperparameters. Besides, the privacy-preserving blockchain and intelligent contract model is designed using the Ethereum library to offer privacy to the distributed IDS engine. The experimental validation on benchmark datasets revealed that the FDNN-HBAID approach had shown the potential to achieve security and privacy in the cloud infrastructure. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The centralized storage and centralized authorization approach in medical information systems can lead to data tampering and private information privacy leakage, while the traditional access control model has an overly simple authentication approach, relies excessively on trusted third-party organizations for the enforcement of access control policies, and has low efficiency in processing access requests. To address these problems, this paper proposes an access control model based on the collaboration of blockchain main and side chains, AC-BMS. Firstly, a password-based authentication scheme is designed based on doctors’ identity information; then Polygon side chain is designed to enhance the storage scalability of the blockchain; finally, the access node information on the main Ethereum chain is located on the side chain, and resources are obtained by executing Roll-up contracts deployed on the side chain. It is confirmed by simulation experiments in Hyperledger Fabric that the access efficiency and throughput of the blockchain access model proposed in this paper are improved when the number of accesses is multiplied, the average access time is saved by 2–3 s, the latency time is floating and stable, and the security, scalability, and availability are enhanced. © 2023, The Author(s).},

abstract={Counterfeiting is a worldwide practice that has been an impending problem across all sectors in the market. The problem of counterfeiting generally affects corporations that carry a certain brand value in the market. This illegitimate activity undermines the effort of trademarks and causes serious economic damages to various corporations. The proposed solution aims to address the problem caused by counterfeiting by improving on the existing barcode authentication by developing a Blockchain-based “product authentication” system, which would serve as a robust solution to tackle counterfeiting. The proposed solution uses the inherent immutability of Blockchain for maintaining a database of genuine products in addition to using the traceability nature of Blockchain for monitoring of products across the supply chain. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Agricultural risks associated with weather events, soil conditions, diseases, and pests have risen in recent years due to climate change. These risks have burdened farmers with the shock of financial stress and endangered the region's food security. Despite increasing risks, notable risk management tools like agricultural insurance have not effectively reached marginal farmers in developing economies. This can be attributed to the fact that existing centralized agricultural information systems lack trust factors in sharing and accessing agricultural risk data, which is accompanied by processing delays in insurance payouts. To this end, the emergence of promising technologies like blockchain helps establish trust and automates insurance-based payments with smart contracts. This work proposes a framework called AgriSSIOracle with two key contributions. The first is to have a trusted agricultural Internet of Things (IoT) data sharing that employs blockchain-based Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) and provable credentials. Second is the decentralized oracle-based access control mechanism for smart contracts in agricultural insurance. A method for privacy-preserved authentication and data provenance for agricultural IoT devices is developed with SSI-based Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs). Next, the IoT data sharing scheme is illustrated using publish–subscribe and request–response communication patterns based on the device data credentials. Finally, the decentralized oracle mechanism for smart contracts is built based on multiparty computation for risk-related data access. The implementation of the framework is realized using a permissioned identity blockchain called Hyperledger Indy and Ethereum, which is a public blockchain for smart contracts. The security and privacy analysis confirms that the AgriSSIOracle framework ensures trust factors, particularly authenticity, privacy, data provenance, data integrity, and access control. The framework is evaluated with respect to the transaction throughput, latency, credential issue-verify-revoke time, and resource utilization metrics. The evaluation results prove that the AgriSSIOracle solution is scalable and efficient and meets the requirements of real-time deployment. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The traditional system designed by incorporating the Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) suffers from important issues such as centralization of information, single source of trust, and fails to provide a trusted data-auditing solution due to the involvement of Third Party Auditor (TPA). This article proposes a novel solution by leveraging the concept of blockchain and Distributed Data Storage Service (DDSS) system to mitigate the issues mentioned above. In our model, the sensor nodes are accountable for their activity because the blockchain permanently records the logs of sensor nodes. The proposed solution provides the decentralized authentication of sensor nodes and the information stored in the fully distributed system. Furthermore, a decentralized data-auditing scheme without involving the TPA is also suggested, which finally benefits the user in terms of bandwidth and money. The formal verification of the proposed protocol is done using the Scyther simulator tool, which indicates that the protocol is safe and can protect against the relevant attacks with 100% accuracy. We have estimated the proposed scheme's time complexity and computational efficiencies and compared them with the existing one. The computation and communication overhead of the proposed method is reduced by 22.143% and 12.5% compared with the Khalid et al. (2020) scheme. Lastly, the ethereum platform simulates our solution, confirming that less than USD 2 is required to execute the proposed solution. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The traditional Industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT) ecosystem utilizes the Trusted Third Party (TTP) to store sensitive data, and TTP acts as a middleware for device authentication. Therefore, maintaining data privacy is one of the main challenges and research issues due to third-party involvement. Moreover, several known challenges such as Single-Point-of-Failure (SPoF), trust issues, centralized systems, and security vulnerabilities exist in the IIoT ecosystem. Blockchain is one of the solutions to address above mentioned challenges. This article proposes a fully decentralized system (without TTP) based on the ethereum smart contracts and Interplanetary File System (IPFS) for IIoT. Moreover, we propose a device authentication mechanism by utilizing smart contracts and storing the data in a distributed manner using IPFS. This work also provides data accessing policies for the end-users. The proposed contract is implemented in both JavaScript VM and ropsten test networks. It provides an in-depth analysis of the smart contract while simulating the contract in local and global environments. Moreover, the various costs involved in proposing the protocol are also calculated and compared to current studies. The informal investigation demonstrates that the solutions are secure and meet critical security criteria. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The coronavirus, formerly known as COVID-19, has caused massive global disasters. As a precaution, most governments imposed quarantine periods ranging from months to years and postponed significant financial obligations. Furthermore, governments around the world have used cutting-edge technologies to track citizens’ activity. Thousands of sensors were connected to IoT (Internet of Things) devices to monitor the catastrophic eruption with billions of connected devices that use these novel tools and apps, privacy and security issues regarding data transmission and memory space abound. In this study, we suggest a block-chain-based methodology for safeguarding data in the billions of devices and sensors connected over the internet. Various trial secrecy and safety qualities are based on cutting-edge cryptography. To evaluate the proposed model, we recom-mend using an application of the system, a Raspberry Pi single-board computer in an IoT system, a laptop, a computer, cell phones and the Ethereum smart contract platform. The models ability to ensure safety, effectiveness and a suitable budget is proved by the Gowalla dataset results. © 2023, Tech Science Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract={A data marketplace provides a platform for data trading by bringing together data owners and data consumers with a data broker. Recent advancements in mechanism design of data marketplaces have introduced a number of private data query mechanisms that facilitate the trading of private data. A critical assumption to ensuring that these mechanisms function as intended in a real-world online platform, which is often overlooked in the mechanism design literature, is that they are implemented in a network infrastructure that guarantees secure and fair trade. Such a network infrastructure should allow data storage, communications and transactions to satisfy confidentiality, data integrity, fair brokerage, and privacy requirements. In this paper, we propose SmartAuction, the first blockchain-based secure implementation of a private data query system. SmartAuction utilises a public-key encryption scheme, a digital signature scheme and two smart contracts to facilitate the four tasks of a data trade: data submission, data request, auction and query, and payment and delivery. Using universal composability (UC) framework, we verify that SmartAuction satisfies the desirable properties mentioned above. We also conduct experiment to show that SmartAuction can be implemented in real Ethereum platforms and it has a broad applicability. © 2022},

abstract={Social data produced from widely emerged social media activities are expected to promote information dissemination and engagement, or even make business intelligence more powerful. However, the recent increase in social media incidents of illegal surveillance and data breaches raises questions about the current data ownership model, in which centralized applications collect and control large amounts of user data. In this article, we present SocialChain, which is a decentralized social data storage and sharing system based on blockchain that decouples user data and social applications to return data ownership to the user. We adopt Personal Data Store to extend off-chain storage for the social data, set up an identity establishment mechanism that can support WebID-based authentication functions using a unique identity assignment (i.e., WebID) as well as certificateless cryptography, and design a general framework that leverages smart contracts to help securely store and share social data in an automated manner. We develop a software prototype based on Ethereum and conduct case studies to test the effects of the adopted techniques on the performance. Experimental results show that SocialChain can provide easy-to-use interfaces while introducing relatively low latency, cost, and overhead and that it can support real-world social media applications. © 2008-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={In the Covid-19 pandemic, information about the medical equipment such as personal protective equipment, ventilators, testing kits, oxygen cylinders, ICU beds, and patient diagnostic status is a black box for the patients. This article proposes a blockchain-assisted Covid-19 big data chain (CovidBChain) framework to handle the Covid-19 data, which is of colossal size (volume), coming from different sources (variety) and generated at every time instance (velocity). CovidBChain is proposed to protect electronic health records and Covid-19 equipment's information from illegal modification. CovidBChain provides transparency, access control, and integrity to Covid-19 data. The status of critical equipment like ventilator, Covid-19 beds, oxygen cylinder, and ICU status each such operation is integrated into the CovidBChain as a transaction. A prototype has been simulated using Ganache, Metamask, InterPlanetary File System, and Reactjs. The comparative assessment using proof-of-work (PoW) and proof-of-authority (PoA) deduces that the upload and retrieval time in PoA is less than PoW, while the transaction cost is more in PoW. The overhead of message exchange communication is reduced by a factor of (Formula presented.) in PoA as compared to the PoW approach. CovidBChain has been tested on the Ethereum official test network Ropsten for PoW and Goerli for PoA. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={This paper reports the design, implementation, and experimental phases of the EU H2020 QualiChain pilot “Staffing the Public Sector—The Case of Portugal”. The overall purpose of this pilot is to ensure the authenticity and integrity of the diplomas for all involved stakeholders and therefore to contribute to solving the diploma counterfeiting and/or falsification that is a great threat to the recruitment of qualified personnel. The main innovative aspect of this solution is the integration that is offered between an Academic Management System (the Fenix.edu platform) and a Blockchain (Ethereum) to automatically deploy diplomas. This solution helps the involved stakeholders trust the diplomas provided. The case study involves four different stakeholders and studies, specifically, the increase in their satisfaction in terms of diploma control, diploma veracity, and diploma credibility. The developed system was tested with external participants who were asked to follow a set of guidelines and complete a survey to assess their perceptions. All system interactions were recorded, and the data were analyzed. The results indicated that the participants successfully executed the guidelines and that a perception increase toward diploma control, veracity, and credibility was identified. © 2022 The Authors},

abstract={Nowadays, finding genetic components and determining the likelihood that treatment would be helpful for patients are the key issues in the medical field. Medical data storage in a centralized system is complex. Data storage, on the other hand, has recently been distributed electronically in a cloud-based system, allowing access to the data at any time through a cloud server or blockchain-based ledger system. The blockchain is essential to managing safe and decentralized transactions in cryptography systems such as bitcoin and Ethereum. The blockchain stores information in different blocks, each of which has a set capacity. Data processing and storage are more effective and better for data management when blockchain and machine learning are integrated. Therefore, we have proposed a machine-learning–blockchain-based smart-contract system that improves security, reduces consumption, and can be trusted for real-time medical applications. The accuracy and computation performance of the IoHT system are safely improved by our system. © 2022 by the authors.},

abstract={The inclusion of mobility-based Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices accelerates the data transmission process, thereby catering to IoT users’ demands; however, securing the data transmission in mobility-based IoT is one complex and challenging concern. The adoption of unified security architecture has been identified to prevent side-channel attacks in the IoT, which has been discussed extensively in developing security solutions. Despite blockchain’s apparent superiority in withstanding a wide range of security threats, a careful examination of the relevant literature reveals that some common pitfalls are associated with these methods. Therefore, the proposed scheme introduces a novel computational security framework wherein a branched and decentralized blockchain network is formulated to facilitate coverage from different variants of side-channel IoT attacks that are yet to be adequately reported. A unique blockchain-based authentication approach is designed to secure communication among mobile IoT devices using multiple stages of security implementation with Smart Agreement and physically unclonable functions. Analytical modeling with lightweight finite field encryption is used to create this framework in Python. The study’s benchmark results show that the proposed scheme offers 4% less processing time, 5% less computational overhead, 1% more throughput, 12% less latency, and 30% less energy consumption compared to existing blockchain methods. © 2022 by the authors.},

abstract={An Aadhaar is a unique number issued to every citizen in India. Aadhar’s current identity authentication relies on the central identities data repository (CDIR) of the unique identification authority of India (UIDAI), which is at risk of a single-point fault attack. Perhaps worse, internal attacks can tamper with the sensitive data of authenticated devices without being detected. In this paper, the proposed system utilizes emerging technology: blockchain for solving the issue of centralized authentication. The proposed system provides a distributed, secure, and tamper-proof ledger platform for Aadhar in that Aadhar is implemented using blockchain ethereum technology. The proposed system considers the unique Aadhar identification (ID) for each citizen of India and registered it on the smart contract of ethereum so that this unique ID may be authenticated by each other in a peer-to-peer network without a central authority. For securing the data, the proposed framework uses hashing technique for significant data (i.e. firmware). Blockchain stores hashed data and instantly any change in the state of the data may be possible to detect. © This is an open access article under the CC BY-SA license.},

abstract={Medical records management had always been a challenging in healthcare sector. Traditionally, medical records are handled either manually or electronically that are under the stewardship of hospitals/healthcare institutions. A patient centric approach is the new paradigm where patient is an inherent part of the healthcare ecosystem controlling the access and sharing of his/her personal medical care information. Medical care information requires robust security and privacy. Also there are other issues like confidentiality, interoperability, scalability, cost efficiency and timeliness that need to be addressed. To achieve these objectives, this paper proposes a novel-scalable patient centric yet privacy preserving framework for efficient and secure electronic medical records management. In addition, proposed system generates a unified trusted record and authentication role mapping for enforcing secure access control for medical records using complex encryption algorithms. This paper identifies 13 key performance factors for performance comparison of proposed framework with traditional models. Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain acted as a benchmark platform for performance evaluation of MRBSChain on the basis of three metrics (transaction cost, average block time and deployment cost).At last, a comparative analysis of MRBSChain with other state of art blockchain systems on the basis of execution time is presented in the paper. © 2022, The Author(s).},

abstract={The rapid development of the blockchain leads to a blowout of on-chain transactions, contracts, and currencies, which will further accelerate the increase of data. The existing blockchain systems typically support exact transaction queries, which, however, cannot satisfy the QoS requirements with intelligent adjustment in the blockchain systems. To this end, this paper takes the first step to define and address the practically important problem of transaction cardinality estimation for QoS-adjustable intelligent blockchain systems. We first establish a mathematical relationship between the bit string and transaction cardinality. Thus, we can leverage the number of leading 1s of the obtained bit string to estimate the transaction cardinality. We then improve the block header and body with a corresponding search algorithm to access bit strings in blocks. We also propose an estimation protocol with intelligent adjustable QoS to support accuracy-guaranteed and efficiency-optimized estimation. Finally, we design an authentication scheme and guarantee the reliability of our protocol through rigorous theoretical derivation. When achieving the transaction cardinality estimation in blockchain, two technical challenges need to be addressed. (i) To ensure efficient, verifiable, and overhead-saving bit string accessing mechanism in blockchain, we propose the Merkle Cardinality Tree (MCT) and target block filtering mechanism based on Bloom Filter (BF) in off-chain and improve on-chain block header by joining the abstract of MCT and BF. (ii) To improve estimation efficiency while guaranteeing accuracy requirements in hybrid blockchain scheme, we propose a Dynamic One-round Sampling-based cardinality Estimation (DOSE) protocol and integrate BF-DOSE to intelligently accelerate estimation. We build MCT in Ethereum and store the MCT Root in the block header for estimation authentication. Extensive experiments reveal that our BF-DOSE protocol can well satisfy various accuracy and efficiency requirements of QoS-adjustable intelligent blockchain systems, and is one to two orders of magnitude faster compared with benchmark schemes. © 1983-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Ambient Intelligence (AmI) in Internet of Things (IoT) has empowered healthcare professionals to monitor, diagnose, and treat patients remotely. Besides, the AmI-IoT has improved patient engagement and gratification as doctors’ interactions have become more comfortable and efficient. However, the benefits of the AmI-IoT-based healthcare applications are not availed entirely due to the adversarial threats. IoT networks are prone to cyber attacks due to vulnerable wireless mediums and the absentia of lightweight and robust security protocols. This paper introduces computationally-inexpensive privacy-assuring authentication protocol for AmI-IoT healthcare applications. The use of blockchain & fog computing in the protocol guarantees unforgeability, non-repudiation, transparency, low latency, and efficient bandwidth utilization. The protocol uses physically unclonable functions (PUF), biometrics, and Ethereum powered smart contracts to prevent replay, impersonation, and cloning attacks. Results prove the resource efficiency of the protocol as the smart contract incurs very minimal gas and transaction fees. The Scyther results validate the robustness of the proposed protocol against cyber-attacks. The protocol applies lightweight cryptography primitives (Hash, PUF) instead of conventional public-key cryptography and scalar multiplications. Consequently, the proposed protocol is better than centralized infrastructure-based authentication approaches. © 2022 The Author(s)},

abstract={With the electric power grid experiencing a rapid shift to the smart grid paradigm over a deregulated energy market, Internet of Things (IoT) based solutions are gaining prominence and innovative Peer To Peer (P2P) energy trading at micro-level are being deployed. Such advancement, however leave traditional security models vulnerable and pave the path for Blockchain, an Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) with its decentralized, open and transparency characteristics as a viable alternative. However, due to deregulation in energy trading markets, massive volumes of micro transactions are required to be supported, which become a performance bottleneck with existing Blockchain solution such as Hyperledger, Ethereum and so on. In this paper, a lightweight ’Tangle’ based framework, namely IOTA (Third generation DLT) is employed for designing an energy trading market that uses Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) based solution that not only alleviates the reward overhead for micro-transactions but also provides scalability, quantum-proof, and high throughput of such transactions at low confirmation latency. Furthermore the Masked Authentication Messaging (MAM) protocol is used over the IOTA P2P energy trading framework that allows energy producer and consumer to share the data while maintaining the confidentiality, and facilitates the data accessibility. The Raspberry Pi 3 board along with voltage sensor (INA219) used for the setting up light node and publishing and fetching data from the Tangle. The results of the obtained benchmarking indicate low confirmation latency, high throughput, system with Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum. Moreover, the effect of transaction rate decreases when the IOTA bundle size increases more than 10. For bundle size 5 and 10 it behaves absolutely better than any other platform. The speedy confirmation time of transactions in IOTA, is most suitable for peer to peer energy trading scenarios. This study serves as a guideline for deploying, end-to-end transaction with IOTA Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) and improving the performance of Blockchain in the energy sector under various operating conditions. © 2022, The Author(s).},

abstract={With the rise of blockchain technology, the peer-to-peer (P2P) network system has once again caught people's attention to equipping a blockchain with a big storage capacity. In the traditional P2P file-sharing network systems, such as InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), data stored in the other nodes cannot be revoked by the owner and can only be removed by other nodes themselves. To comply with the criteria of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, it is important to ensure that personal data can be completely removed by their owners. To improve the privacy and security of the P2P file-sharing system, we propose a revocable and monitorable P2P file-sharing system over a consortium blockchain to achieve revocation of files in the decentralized environment. By using a trusted execution environment, such as Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX), the proposed scheme can verify the integrity of the executables of the P2P file-sharing system and generate a file authentication code for each IPFS node to make sure that the system is synchronized correctly. This scheme elaborately integrates the autonomous smart contracts and Intel SGX hardware to obtain the monitorable merit. The experimental results suggest that enhancing the security and privacy take modest computing costs into consideration. To the best of our knowledge, this scheme is the first attempt to achieve the P2P file-sharing system with securely revocable functions. © 2007-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={The popularity of electric vehicles (EVs) is constantly increasing, as they use relatively greener, sustainable energy. However, it is a fact that the charging stations for EVs are yet to meet the demand. It could be a great solution if a peer-to-peer (P2P) charging system could be initiated by anyone who wants to make their garage’s charge points publicly available for commercial purposes, named a home charging station (HCS). In this work, our idea is to bring interested charging stations under a network of nodes and a blockchain-based management system, where the blockchain is responsible for ensuring the authenticity of both the charging stations and charge receiver. A cryptocurrency-based payment system has also been proposed to ensure transactions’ security, integrity, transparency, and immutability. A reputation management system is applied to maintain the quality of service. Miners with high processing power are used to alleviate lagging during block creation, supported by edge servers. The proposed system has been implemented by using virtual machines. A theoretical analysis is presented to assess the compatibility and possible cost requirements to implement the system in a real-world scenario. © 2022 by the authors.},

abstract={Many researchers have introduced blockchain into the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) to support trading or other authentication applications between vehicles. However, the traditional blockchain cannot well support the query of transactions that occur in a specified area which is important for vehicle users since they are bound to the geolocations. Therefore, the querying efficiency of the geolocation attribute of transactions is vital for blockchain-based applications. Existing work does not well handle the geolocation of vehicles in the blockchain, and thus the querying efficiency is questionable. In this paper, we design a rapid query method of regional transactions in blockchain for IoV, including data structures and query algorithms. The main idea is to utilize the Geohash code to represent the area and serve as the key for transaction indexing and querying, and the geolocation is marked as one of the attributes of transactions in the blockchain. To further verify and evaluate the proposed design, on the basis of the implementation of Ethereum, which is a well-known blockchain, the results show that the proposed design achieves significantly better-querying speed than Ethereum. © 2022 by the authors.},

abstract={Advancement in the Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing has escalated the number of connected edge devices in a smart city environment. Having billions more devices has contributed to security concerns, and an attack-proof authentication mechanism is the need of the hour to sustain the IoT environment. Securing all devices could be a huge task and require lots of computational power, and can be a bottleneck for devices with fewer computational resources. To improve the authentication mechanism, many researchers have proposed decentralized applications such as blockchain technology for securing fog and IoT environments. Ethereum is considered a popular blockchain platform and is used by researchers to implement the authentication mechanism due to its programable smart contract. In this research, we proposed a secure authentication mechanism with improved performance. Neo blockchain is a platform that has properties that can provide improved security and faster execution. The research utilizes the intrinsic properties of Neo blockchain to develop a secure authentication mechanism. The proposed authentication mechanism is compared with the existing algorithms and shows that the proposed mechanism is 20 to 90 per cent faster in execution time and has over 30 to 70 per cent decrease in registration and authentication when compared to existing methods. © 2022 by the authors.},

abstract={To tackle the problems of questioning the authenticity of products faced in e-commerce live streaming and the low data integrity in the process of product transactions, the concept of traceability and a product authentication scheme that integrates blockchain technology and traceability are proposed. The proposed scheme deploys the product authentication strategy on the Ethereum blockchain in the form of a smart contract and calls the product authentication method on the traceability body by executing the smart contract to realize the authentication of product quality. A combination of on-chain and off-chain is used to store private information to guarantee information integrity. Security analysis results show that the proposed scheme can make the risk of information leakage lower and data security higher under the premise of achieving product certification. A system simulation experiment shows that the solution can meet product certification requirements and have a favorable impact on the live commerce industry. © 2022 by the authors.},

abstract={The advent of Ethereum opened up a pandora box of decentralized possibilities. While allowing for the replicated, decentralized computation of Turing-complete instructions, platforms such as Ethereum do not offer the possibility of direct, interactive, real-time processing of users’ inputs that could later affect the decentralized state machine. They cannot directly observe, replicate and authenticate users’ actions performed in real-time while presenting the results of these. They lack mechanics that would incentivize full-nodes to provide low-latency-constrained services to users in-between epochs of a decentralized state machine, thus pushing dApps’ developers towards hybrid architectures—ones employing centralized servers while not even considering certain applications, due to the aforementioned limitations. In this research paper, we explore our results of an attempt to create a ‘decentralized operating system’ user experience a reality. We propose an architecture which solves the problems of the responsiveness and finalization of multiple actions performed by users in real-time—without the need for users to pre-authenticate but after having presented a single, unitary consent to commit—through the hereby proposed Deferred Authentication mechanism. To allow for this, we employ an in-house developed #GridScript programming language, used by our decentralized state machine, along with a computer-vision-enabled and AI-aided mobile app (available for both iOS and Android). We introduce the concept of Decentralized Processing Threads (DPTs) and see how these enable fascinating possibilities. In addition, we look into how Access-Control-Lists (ACLs)-enabled, incentivized storage, incentivized Sybil-proof communication, embedded firewall apparatus, integrated off-the-chain payments, and crypto-incentivized off-the-chain storage aid such a system and thus render it as feasible. We highlight various interesting troubles we have encountered, such as state recovery after disconnects of the UI and the replication of its state across both nodes maintaining the network and web browsers. We depict ‘off-the-chain’ mechanics, which we use to reward for real-time services provided to users by nodes maintaining the network. We tackle crypto-incentivized WebRTC swarms not needing centralized servers for signaling. We look into a user-friendly approach to Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). The test-bed is readily available with multiple functional UI dApps already in place. Indeed, the paper presents UI and UX design decisions we have undertaken based on conclusions from statistical research results on a group of 50,341 volunteers over 4 years, which we have used to formulate what we codenamed as the Venice UI/UX design paradigm. We extend upon the notion of Token Pools to allow for the Sybil-proof incentivization of multiple-peers from a single data structure stored on the decentralized state machine. © 2022 by the authors.},

abstract={Electronic voting systems must find solutions to various issues with authentication, data privacy and integrity, transparency, and verifiability. On the other hand, Blockchain technology offers an innovative solution to many of these problems. The scalability of Blockchain has arisen as a fundamental barrier to realizing the promise of this technology, especially in electronic voting. This study seeks to highlight the solutions regarding scalable Blockchain-based electronic voting systems and the issues linked with them while also attempting to foresee future developments. A systematic literature review (SLR) was used to complete the task, leading to the selection of 76 articles in the English language from 1 January 2017 to 31 March 2022 from the famous databases. This SLR was conducted to identify well-known proposals, their implementations, verification methods, various cryptographic solutions in previous research to evaluate cost and time. It also identifies performance parameters, the primary advantages and obstacles presented by different systems, and the most common approaches for Blockchain scalability. In addition, it outlines several possible research avenues for developing a scalable electronic voting system based on Blockchain technology. This research helps future research before proposing or developing any solutions to keep in mind all the voting requirements, merits, and demerits of the proposed solutions and provides further guidelines for scalable voting solutions. © 2022 by the authors.},

abstract={5G cellular network is becoming a preferred technology for communication in deployments of the Internet of Things (IoT). However, 5G cellular network is essentially designed for cellular communication. Therefore, there are several areas in IoT over 5G cellular network, where there is scope for further improvement. One such area is development of efficient security mechanisms for authentication of the IoT devices. The authentication protocol currently being used in 5G cellular network maintains the security credentials of the devices at the home network in a centralised manner. Therefore, every time a device needs to be authenticated, the home network has to be communicated. However, considering the IoT scenario where there is large scale deployment of devices, frequent communication with the home network may result in increased communication latency. In this paper, we propose an authentication scheme where security credentials of the IoT devices are stored in a decentralized way using blockchain technology. The scheme is found to be safe and secured, through an informal and a formal security analysis using scyther tool. The smart contracts used in the scheme, when deployed in the ethereum test network, are also found to be efficient. Through experimental performance analysis, the scheme is found to have attained reduced communication latency compared to the existing protocols. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Financial institutions are following an open banking (OB) trend for service innovation and integration. OB allows third-party service providers (TSPs) to access user financial data for purposes of finding the best deals and improving user experiences. The trust in third parties required for OB ecosystem success raises questions about digital identity integration, data sharing, and privacy preservation. Decentralized applications (DApps) for classifying and protecting data privacy, recording user consent, tracking TSP access actions, managing application programming interfaces (APIs), and preserving self-sovereign identities already exist, but in some countries such as Taiwan they have yet to be integrated into an operable three-phase OB approach. After identifying all major requirements of primary OB participants, we develop a blockchain-based identity management and access control (BIMAC) framework that shares some advantages of both traditional banking and blockchain technology. The BIMAC infrastructure applies smart contracts and a stateless authentication mechanism to form a reliable personal information transaction security control (PITSC) platform that offers such functionalities as decentralized third-party login (TPL), the ability to open bank accounts online, data authorization/revocation, integrated payouts, and TSP access monitoring. System performance evaluation results indicate that the frequent execution functions of the proposed framework have lower computation costs than the average transaction cost of public Ethereum. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as a powerful technology for introducing untraditional solutions to many challenges in non-military fields and industrial applications in the next few years. However, the limitations of a drone’s battery and the available optimal charging techniques represent a significant challenge in using UAVs on a large scale. This problem means UAVs are unable to fly for a long time; hence, drones’ services fail dramatically. Due to this challenge, optimizing the scheduling of drone charging may be an unusual solution to drones’ battery problems. Moreover, authenticating drones and verifying their charging transactions with charging stations is an essential associated problem. This paper proposes a scheduling and secure drone charging system in response to these challenges. The proposed system was simulated on a generated dataset consisting of 300 drones and 50 charging station points to evaluate its performance. The optimization of the proposed scheduling methodology was based on the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and game theory-based auction model. In addition, authenticating and verifying drone charging transactions were executed using a proposed blockchain protocol. The optimization and scheduling results showed the PSO algorithm’s efficiency in optimizing drone routes and preventing drone collisions during charging flights with low error rates with an MAE = 0.0017 and an MSE = 0.0159. Moreover, the investigation to authenticate and verify the drone charging transactions showed the efficiency of the proposed blockchain protocol while simulating the proposed system on the Ethereum platform. The obtained results clarified the efficiency of the proposed blockchain protocol in executing drone charging transactions within a short time and low latency within an average of 0.34 s based on blockchain performance metrics. Moreover, the proposed scheduling methodology achieved a 96.8% success rate of drone charging cases, while only 3.2% of drones failed to charge after three scheduling rounds. © 2022 by the authors.},

abstract={Blockchain has found many applications, apart from Bitcoin, in different fields and it has the potential to be very useful in the satellite communications and space industries. Decentralized and secure protocols for processing and manipulating space transactions of satellite swarms in the form of Space Digital Tokens (SDT) can be built using blockchain technology. Tokenizing space transactions using SDTs will open the door to different new blockchain-based solutions for the advancement of constellation-based satellite communications in the space industry. Developing blockchain solutions using smart contracts could be used in securely authenticating various P2P satellite communications and transactions within/between satellite swarms. To manage and secure these transactions, using the proposed SDT concept, this paper suggested a blockchain-based protocol called Proof of Space Transactions (PoST). This protocol was adopted to manage and authenticate the transactions of satellite constellations in a P2P connection. The PoST protocol was prototyped using the Ethereum blockchain and experimented with to evaluate its performance using four metrics: read latency, read throughput, transaction latency, and transaction throughput. The simulation results clarified the efficiency of the proposed PoST protocol in processing and verifying satellite transactions in a short time according to read and transaction latency results. Moreover, the security results showed that the proposed PoST protocol is secure and efficient in verifying satellite transactions according to true positive rate (TPR), true negative rate (TNR), and accuracy metrics. These findings may shape a real attempt to develop a new generation of Blockchain-based satellite constellation systems. © 2022 by the authors.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) has widely expanded due to its advantages in enhancing the business, industrial, and social ecosystems. Nevertheless, IoT infrastructure is susceptible to several cyber-attacks due to the endpoint devices’ restrictions in computation, storage, and communication capacity. As such, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks pose a serious threat to the security of the IoT. Attackers can easily utilize IoT devices as part of botnets to launch DDoS attacks by taking advantage of their flaws. This paper proposes an Ethereum blockchain model to detect and prevent DDoS attacks against IoT systems. Additionally, the proposed system can be used to resolve the single points of failure (dependencies on third parties) and privacy and security in IoT systems. First, we propose implementing a decentralized platform in place of current centralized system solutions to prevent DDoS attacks on IoT devices at the application layer by authenticating and verifying these devices. Second, we suggest tracing and recording the IP address of malicious devices inside the blockchain to prevent them from connecting and communicating with the IoT networks. The system performance has been evaluated by performing 100 experiments to evaluate the time taken by the authentication process. The proposed system highlights two messages with a time of 0.012 ms: the first is the request transmitted from the IoT follower device to join the blockchain, and the second is the blockchain response. The experimental evaluation demonstrated the superiority of our system because there are fewer I/O operations in the proposed system than in other related works, and thus it runs substantially faster. © 2022 by the authors.},

abstract={Integration of healthcare and Internet of Things (IoT) has a potential to revolutionize the medical treatments, diagnosis and predict medical issues thereby enabling patients, families, doctors and medical insurers stay connected for a proactive delivery of services. However, IoT devices operate in infrastructure-less environments, and hence data security and privacy is always a concern. Counterfeit IoT devices create huge menace in sensitive applications. Moreover, conventional healthcare systems are not patient-centric in the sense that they do not include patient's emotions during treatments. EI helps the clinicians better understand and mange medical procedures. This paper presents a human-centered approach in healthcare domain by the integration of emotional intelligence (EI) and sensor network built around IoT devices. A Raspberry Pi connected with sensors and a camera acts as an IoT device. These sensors collect body vital parameters and Facial expression recognition (FER) based EI. The system is hosted on an Ethereum permissioned blockchain for reliability, security and tamper-proof data sharing and storage. Devices in the network are authenticated using physical unclonable functions (PUFs). Comparative analysis confirms that the PUF-based authentication is 330% faster than conventional methods. The system offers latency of as low as 20 ms. Using smart contracts, the proposed model provides role-based access control and helps in building scalable and harmonious digital healthcare platforms. © 2001-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={The development of the IoT is rapidly growing. These IoT devices are mainly deployed to control and report environmental changes, prevent risks, and bring many beneficial services. However, these benefits may open doors to the adversaries in conjunction with security vulnerabilities and privacy issues. In the recent past, Blockchain has been an emerging technology that reaches several use-cases apart from cryptocurrency. For instance, IoT integration with Blockchain implementation yet indefinite required further research because of resource-constrained IoT devices and ledger-based Blockchain protocol design. This paper presents the systematic implementation of securing IoT devices by enabling the Ethereum Blockchain smart contract. The results show that the collected information is securely stored in the Blockchain after successful authentication. Practical Application: Blockchain innovations have the power to transform manufacturing, construction, healthcare and building supply chains by eliminating the middleman, streamlining operations, improving overall security, and simplifying data management. Onboarding, recordkeeping, client screening, data management, security, privacy, and transaction and trade processing are examples of several practice applications in the financial, insurance, and eHealth services industries. Thus, this study ensures security by enabling Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts in an authentic blockchain applications for building sustainable environments to improve readability and trustworthiness of the transactions. © The Author(s) 2022.},

abstract={We aim at building a generic future-generation, secure communication framework on top of blockchain using signcryption. A publicly verifiable signcryption scheme not only ensures data confidentiality and authentication, but also enables messages to be verified or audited non-interactively. With blockchain as trustworthy computation and storage services, the proposed secure communication framework achieves tamper-resistance, non-repudiation, availability and public verification. Moreover, we consider both large-size data (e.g., file) and small-size data (e.g., cryptographic hash or key) transfer paradigms, where blockchain and signcryption schemes are seamlessly combined. In particular, IPFS is used as a hash oracle and decentralized storage platform in big data transfer. © 2022 Owner/Author.},

abstract={Secure authentication between user equipment and 5G core network is a critical issue for 5G system. However, the traditional authentication protocol 5G-AKA and the centralized key database are at risk of several security problems, e.g. key leakage, impersonation attack, MitM attack and single point of failure. In this paper, a blockchain based asymmetric authentication and key agreement protocol (BC-AKA) is proposed for distributed 5G core network. In particular, the key used in the authentication process is replaced from a symmetric key to an asymmetric key, and the database used to store keys in conventional 5G core network is replaced with a blockchain network. A proof of concept system for distributed 5G core network is built based on Ethereum and ECC-Secp256k1, and the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed scheme are verified by the experiment results. © 2013 China Institute of Communications.},

abstract={The increasing use of smart metering infrastructure invites security threats through trusted insiders in spite of the devices’ authentication phase. Trusted insiders equipped with high privilege are also become vulnerable to being attacked. In the presence of these malicious or compromised insiders, it becomes difficult to achieve an efficient, transparent, reliable, and cost-effective smart grid. Addressing the issues arising from an insider attack, we explore post-authentication attacks and present a reputation score-based model using blockchain technology. The reputation of a device is computed based on the neighbor’s opinion. The opinions and incentives are stored on a blockchain to ensure integrity, availability, and decentralization. We analyze the latency of the proposed model by modifying the open-source Go Ethereum and security effectiveness through a reputation simulator. In addition to this, storage, communication, resource usage overhead, and security requirements are also analyzed to prove the efficiency of the proposed model for the lightweight smart metering infrastructure. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE.},

abstract={The use of low-cost sensors in IoT over high-cost devices has been considered less expensive. However, these low-cost sensors have their own limitations such as the accuracy, quality, and reliability of the data collected. Fog computing offers solutions to those limitations; nevertheless, owning to its intrinsic distributed architecture, it faces challenges in the form of security of fog devices, secure authentication and privacy. Blockchain technology has been utilised to offer solutions for the authentication and security challenges in fog systems. This paper proposes an authentication system that utilises the characteristics and advantages of blockchain and smart contracts to authenticate users securely. The implemented system uses the email address, username, Ethereum address, password and data from a biometric reader to register and authenticate users. Experiments showed that the proposed method is secure and achieved performance improvement when compared to existing methods. The comparison of results with state-of-the-art showed that the proposed authentication system consumed up to 30% fewer resources in transaction and execution cost; however, there was an increase of up to 30% in miner fees. © 2022 by the authors.

abstract={Advancements in cryptography and computer science have given birth to blockchain technology. One of the most exciting evolutions of blockchain is the advancements in smart contract technology. Smart contracts can be used for a broad range of use cases, not just financial transactions. Smart contract technology on the public blockchain, represented by Ethereum, due to its public and opaque nature, is not a good choice for many scenarios that do not require full disclosure, such as many IoT applications. On the other hand, the existing blockchain smart contract system still has a strong connection with virtual currency, which also limits its application in non-financial scenarios. In order to solve the above problems and explore more of the potential of smart contracts for the IoT application domain, this paper mainly explores the construction of a smart contract system based on consortium blockchains associated with no virtual currency. Based on the smart contract system designed in this project, blockchain can be more easily applied in payment, product traceability, authority authentication, and other fields. Through a certain centralized way, the system is easier to manage, can reduce the management expenditure, and the power and other resource consumption is less, which is conducive to environmental protection. Results show that our smart contract system has the potential for IoT usage in the future. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Security has always been the main concern for the internet of things (IoT)-based systems. Blockchain, with its decentralized and distributed design, prevents the risks of the existing centralized methodologies. Conventional security and privacy architectures are inapplicable in the spectrum of IoT due to its resource constraints. To overcome this problem, this paper presents a Blockchain-based security mechanism that enables secure authorized access to smart city resources. The presented mechanism comprises the ACE (Authentication and Authorization for Constrained Environments) framework-based authorization Blockchain and the OSCAR (Object Security Architecture for the Internet of Things) object security model. The Blockchain lays out a flexible and trustless authorization mechanism, while OSCAR makes use of a public ledger to structure multicast groups for authorized clients. Moreover, a meteor-based application is developed to provide a user-friendly interface for heterogeneous technologies belonging to the smart city. The users would be able to interact with and control their smart city resources such as traffic lights, smart electric meters, surveillance cameras, etc., through this application. To evaluate the performance and feasibility of the proposed mechanism, the authorization Blockchain is implemented on top of the Ethereum network. The authentication mechanism is developed in the node.js server and a smart city is simulated with the help of Raspberry Pi B+. Furthermore, mocha and chai frameworks are used to assess the performance of the system. Experimental results reveal that the authentication response time is less than 100 ms even if the average hand-shaking time increases with the number of clients. © 2022 by the authors.

abstract={Blockchain is a system of recording information in a way that makes it difficult or impossible to change, hack, or cheat the system. A blockchain is essentially a digital ledger of transactions that is duplicated and distributed across the entire network of computer systems on the blockchain. Blockchain is an especially promising and revolutionary technology because it helps reduce risk, stamps out fraud, and brings transparency in a scalable way for myriad uses. Blockchain offers decentralised credentials, making it a global system. It also promotes user-to-user data transmission. However, blockchain-based identity management is crucial for data security. The user owns the identification. Blockchain-based IDMs solve conventional IDM flaws. As technology advances, so does the need for user data protection. Advance payment to safeguard data is unacceptable. So, identity management solutions assist overcome the flaws. Blockchain consists of three important concepts: blocks, nodes, and miners. Blockchain makes life simpler by changing the way personal data is stored are made available. While the government and other third parties are addressing the problem, the users are still exposed to identity management. Personal identity management takes increasing security and productivity. Blockchain eliminates the third party by transferring data between two entities. This work develops a categorization model for Ethereum addresses based on a few criteria. Voting categorization outperforms the other models with an accuracy of 88.89% and an AUC Score of 97%. © 2021, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to The Society for Reliability Engineering, Quality and Operations Management (SREQOM), India and The Division of Operation and Maintenance, Lulea University of Technology, Sweden.},

abstract={The advantages provided by the drones with regards to three dimensional mobility and ease of deployment makes them a viable candidate for 5G and beyond (B5G) networks. Significant amount of research has been conducted on the aspect of networking for using drones as base stations to provide different services. In this work, we deviate from the traditional use of drones to provide connectivity and explore the delivery of products through drones in the context of maintaining social distancing. However, drone delivery process for critical applications such as delivering medical supplies is vulnerable to attacks such as impersonation attacks. The security of drone operation is important to save the users from any breaches that can lead to financial and physical losses. To cope with these security issues and to make the delivery process transparent, we propose a blockchain-based drone delivery system that registers and authenticates the participating entities including products (medical supplies), warehouse (medical centers) and drones. To this end, we utilize Ethereum platform for implementation of blockchain and smart contract and we present an analysis of different factors that influence the authentication process in terms of time and the number of transactions. Furthermore, to make the communication of a drone with command and control center more secure and robust, we use machine learning (ML)-based intrusion detection system. © 2021},

abstract={Blockchain has much more to it than just cryptocurrencies because of its flexible nature. It is one of the most imaginative advances and troublesome too, which is the central perpetual, decentralized, ledger of records. Undoubtedly, it is a revolution in systems of record. As blockchain innovation re-architects our digital framework, it additionally reformulates the security condition and also promises to revolutionize the management of smart cities. They can have a large number of users everywhere throughout the world as they are distributed networks. Cryptography is used to secure the whole data residing in the blockchain where each client can add information. It can be done by utilizing an arrangement of three keys (public, private, and the receiver's key) that permit individuals to check the integrity of the information. Blockchain network does not have a central authority. This innovation has already rooted into the finance and banking areas by its uncommon straightforwardness, adaptability, and security that encourage the management of exchanges in a decentralized way. Features like distributed and peer-authentication empower it to span across auxiliary areas like smart grids, government public services, reputation systems, smart cities with IoT, and security services. However, it can change different enterprises, including logistics, healthcare, supply chain, insurance, and considerably more. Well-known enterprises like Samsung and IBM are likewise embracing blockchain innovation to attempt imaginative solutions and approaches to enterprises and new businesses. Nowadays, the fastest-growing skill on the platform is blockchain, who is leaving behind the skills like TensorFlow and Machine Learning as well as led to an increase in demand for developers of blockchain. Solidity, Geth, Mist, Remix, and Metamask are the different blockchain advancement tools. Various blockchain technologies are public blockchain, consortium or federated blockchains, and private blockchains. Ethereum, BigchainDB, HydraChain, and Corda are some of the examples of blockchain platforms. Whereas, Ethereum is considered as one of the best open-source blockchain platforms, which helps in running smart contract and gives distinctive tools for programming to make them. The blockchain applications are the recent pattern in the computerized world. It has the capability to change customary organizations. But to ride the rush of their fame, knowledge regarding the usage of tools and technology is must to create a perfect product. This chapter highlights the major characteristics, architecture, and taxonomy of blockchain technology. Furthermore, it also provides an insight into the various consensus algorithms and main application areas in the blockchain technology. © 2022 Scrivener Publishing LLC.},

abstract={It is difficult to construct a general authentication structure to verify the similarity calculation process of image type data, so the verification of encrypted image retrieval results faces great challenges.At the same time, most existing encrypted image retrieval schemes do not consider the problem of malicious cloud servers, and may return incorrect or incomplete retrieval results.Taking advantage of the decentralized and tamper proof characteristics of blockchain technology,  a Blockchain-based Verifiable Encrypted Image Retrieval (BVEIR)scheme is proposed to ensure the reliability of search results and the transparency of search process.With the encrypted index stored in blockchain (Ethereum), the search function is implemented by using the consensus mechanism of blockchain on the smart contract to ensure the completeness of search results.At the same time, the corresponding encrypted image data is outsourced to the cloud server to reduce storage cost.In the process of similarity image indexing, the double-layer index structure adopting visual word bag model and simhash is used to improve the retrieval efficiency and accuracy.Experimental results show that BVEIR displays good privacy protection effect.Its indexing time is less than that of the SEIR scheme, and can realize fine-grained access control of image data, so it can improve the indexing efficiency and ensure the accuracy of image retrieval. © 2022, Editorial Office of Computer Engineering.

abstract={The proposed work is a blockchain-based E-Voting system which is designed to incorporate privacy, authenticity, and verifiability in the electoral process. Solidity programming language is used to implement smart contracts stored on the Ethereum blockchain which are executed automatically when predefined conditions are met. An Ethereum-based E-Voting decentralised application is deployed which authenticates users with the help of biometric factors and verifies it with the existing E-Aadhaar database.In this model, the paper presents the novel idea of deploying an upgradable smart contract where the election manager can decide whether the voting application would require either a version change, virtual upgrades or feature modifications in the future. This is achieved by using the OpenZeppelin plugin deployed on truffle which uses the concept of ''proxy pattern.'' This methodology helps us to improve and enhance the logic of smart contracts that are normally non-editable once deployed. The parameters used for authentication include the user's EmailID, Registration ID(Aadhar), and facial scan for biometric verification along with other details related to the voter's biodata. © 2022 IEEE.},

abstract={The emergence of Smart Homes (SH) has changed a lot our lifestyle. Connecting several objects to provide autonomous objects function is called 'Internet of Things (IoT) technology'. Objects can be connected without any intervention and give remote access to the owners. With technological advancement, SH and many other IoT technologies have greatly expanded. Homes becoming equipped by hundreds of sensors, smart objects and they have connected with other smart application (smart healthcare, smart market, etc.). Indeed, this scalability brought more sophistication and prosperity but in revenge, it has revealed new security threat. Previous security mechanisms are no longer effective due to their centralized architecture. Most of conventional access control systems are limited in term of Wireless sensor network (WSN) constraint (e.g., limited in terms of energy, communication bandwidth and processing). To mitigate this problem and strengthen security of SH we propose a new lightweight system called Smart Home Access Control System (SHSystem) based on blockchain model. In our method, the access control is optimized by using the keys. The system uses two keys one for the registration phase and the second (calculated by using the first key) for verification phase. To ensure the IoT devices requirement, high efficiency and lightweight calculation we use light keys and light operation. Finally, we present simulation of the method in remix editor, and we analyse our approach in term of gas. The obtained results confirm the efficiency of the method for different attacks. © 2022 IEEE.},

abstract={Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), an emerging architecture that embodies flying ad-hoc networks, face critical privacy and security challenges, mainly when engaged in data-sensitive missions. Therefore, message authentication is a crucial security feature for drone communication. This paper presents a Blockchain-based Efficient, and Trusted Authentication scheme for UAV communication BETA-UAV, which exploits the inherent properties of blockchain technology concerning memorability and immutable to record communication sessions via transaction using a smart contract. The smart contract in BETA-UAV allows participants to publish and call transactions from the blockchain network. Furthermore, the transaction addresses are proof of freshness and trustworthiness for subsequent transmissions. Furthermore, we investigate the ability to resist active attacks, e.g., impersonation, replaying, and modification. In addition, we evaluate the gas costs associated with the smart contract's functions by implementing BETA-UAV on the Ethereum public blockchain. Comparing computation and communication over-heads shows that the proposed approach can save significant costs over traditional techniques. © 2022 IEEE.},

abstract={Biometric authentication methods generally rely on centralized authority such as centralized database servers to store biometric templates and manage authentication. These methods suffer from different points of attack. If the central entity is compromised, the system becomes vulnerable and unable to ensure integrity of stored templates. This paper proposes a distributed scheme of biometric authentification, eliminating the need for a central entity. The proposal is based on the Ethereum blockchain, which offers decentralized and irreversible properties for the storage and management of biometric templates. For each user, the fingerprint template is encrypted using homomorphic encryption and stored on the smart card. The hashed encrypted vector is then stored on the blockchain to ensure its confidentiality. Our proposed scheme, allows authentication of users using a smart contract, while the distance calculation is performed on the encrypted domain that achieves the integrity of the calculation results. By using hashed vectors, the proposal is efficient and cost-effective. These improvements provide solutions to many problems in biometric systems such as template modification, channel interception, and override comparator. © 2022 IEEE.},

abstract={In the past decades, people had to carry a bunch of documents for acquiring citizen beneficiary services such as opening a bank account, issue of a new sim card, new gas connection, Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana etc. In this digital era, Aadhaar is acting as the driving force to gain all citizen services. Unfortunately, lot of security breaches have been occurred on compromising the Aadhaar details which is stored in the database. Providing security to Aadhaar data and mitigate the misuse of other's Aadhaar data to gain citizen services by unauthenticated users is a main concern. Hence, a secure and authenticated system is required to store and use the Aadhaar details securely by authenticated user. In this paper, we are proposing a secure authenticated system which uses IPFS to store finger prints of the customers and blockchain is used to store the Aadhaar details of the registered citizens. In this system, the biometric is integrated with blockchain to secure Aadhaar details and authenticate the customers before providing any citizen services. The system also generates the Aadhaar card after passing redundancy check for customers who do not have Aadhaar card to access the citizen services. The system is tested and verified for multiple citizen services. © 2022 IEEE.},

abstract={Due to increased mobility and growth in global students, as well as the current issue of diploma forgery and the sale of forged certificates, the storage and sharing of student educational records continues to present numerous privacy challenges. This paper proposes block chain-based decentralized certificate management systems in higher education. In this scheme, diploma management tasks like preserving, issuing, and verifying are implemented by the Proof of Work consensus algorithm. Encrypted data, keywords, and digital signatures are stored using cryptographic algorithms like (secure hash Algorithm) SHA-256 and (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) ECDSA. This system allows any individual student to be able to store and access educational certificates. College students can send their certificate hash value to verify their certificates so that organizations can verify the students' certificates using blockchain. Security and performance evaluations reveal that security and privacy preservation are possible with this proposed system. The proposed method is executed using Ethereum and the Solidity programming language. The proposed methodology can be employed by any university to tailor its education to the unique requirements of professional fields recognized by the industry's employers. Additionally, this method offers companies a platform where the employees' academic histories may be checked. This makes it simpler for students, organizations, and other sectors to get consent for student data. © 2022 IEEE.},

abstract={In traditional machine learning approach, data gathered from all the edge devices are sent to centralized server for training and prediction of the output. In the centralized approach, user has to compromise on the data privacy and integrity in sharing their own data to centralized server. To overcome this issue federated machine learning approach was introduced, in which model and data are decentralized and the machine learning model will be trained on the data in local devices and parameters will be sent to cloud server for consensus change, enhancing the data privacy of the users. But still authentication of the nodes to cloud server and vice versa is a major concern to be addressed in federated machine learning as malicious nodes can impersonate as authenticated node and communicate to cloud server. In the proposed model, node authentication is implemented using Ethereum based blockchain with smart contracts thereby enhancing security of Federated machine learning approach. The efficiency of the node authentication is measured and compared with machine learning algorithms which achieves 99% accuracy. © 2022 IEEE.},

abstract={With the development of global informatization and digitalization, a large number of digital content works are produced, such as e-books, music, videos and so on. The copyright registration mechanism provided by the traditional third-party copyright management platform can no longer meet the needs of the rapid development trend of digital works. This paper proposes a digital music copyright system based on blockchain. On the Ethereum platform, smart contracts are designed to achieve copyright registration, music authentication and music crowdfunding. Digital signature technology is used to realize the authentication and authorization of transaction information. The Shazam algorithm is used to extract the audio fingerprint. The Interplanetary File System (IPFS) stores the extracted audio fingerprint, and the blockchain stores the hash value generated by IPFS. Compared with the existing system, the function of this system is more perfect. And innovatively through smart contract and digital signature technology, this system realizes the authentication and authorization of transaction information. In particular, it ensures the authenticity of the crowdfunding campaign. © 2022 IEEE.},

abstract={Every day thousands or millions of digital content or assets have been created and transected through the digital marketplace. Most of the cases after creating the content in the digital market a seller completely lose their content ownership and creative content. Not only that the entire system is centralized which means the whole transaction, information sharing, and database update are maintained by the third-party organization. And no contact verification and authentication happen between two parties. Also, generate the possibilities of data manipulation risk for a large amount of data. To solve this problem, we have introduced Ethereum blockchain-based digital marketplace where we use NFT-based smart contracts to verify and authenticate every transaction between buyer, seller, and marketplace owner. Our proposed system operated as a decentralized and distributed ledger. To develop the NFT-based smart contract we use the ERC721 token standard which provides us the non-fungible properties. We use two smart contracts to develop the whole infrastructure. One is for creating a market item and another one is for the marketplace. Also, develop the payment mechanism for our proposed structure and collect the listing fees. So, the proposed Ethereum blockchain-based digital marketplace is secure, trusted, immutable, and properly authenticated by the decentralized network. © 2022 IEEE.},

abstract={In order to maintain sustainability and agricultural stability, the global world needs a complicated yet essential food supply system called a global food chain. In recent years, organisations involved in the food industry worldwide have often taken the food supply chain for given, forgetting that even a little disruption in the network might result in severe illness, shortages, or higher pricing. The most fragile individuals in society, such as the poor and small retailers and restaurants, are consistently impacted by this. The food supply chain has become broader and more complicated due to the expansion of the industry throughout the world, which prevents the old transportation model from meeting customer expectation. Food distribution chains face a number of difficulties, including poor traceability and connectivity, the availability of phoney food goods, and ineffective facility inspection. As a result, a system that provides accurate product details and a trustworthy transaction method are required. In this paper, we have outlined a complete approach to utilise Ethereum to improve the supply chain customer-centric. By providing genuine data about the products from the start, blockchain technology in the food business applies in a thoughtful and comprehensive approach to check and certify the food's quality items. This research effort includes discusses issue conceptualization, modelling, and performance monitoring. © 2022 IEEE.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm is a relatively novel concept that is rapidly and steadily growing in modern wireless communication models. In IoT, many of the objects in the surrounding environment of us are networked in one or more forms. Sensor network technologies are increasing to meet this new challenge where invisible information and communication systems are embedded in our surroundings. This produces a large amount of information that must be acquired, transferred, stored, sorted, processed, and presented in an integrated, efficient, sensible, and easily interpretable format. Therefore, this interaction and cooperation between humans and smart devices create new challenges for exchanging information security. On the other hand, the lack of appropriate and strong security services, arrangements, and measures can have a negative or even detrimental effect on the objective acceptance of the IoT paradigm. This paper delves into the impacts of the message queuing telemetry transport (MQTT) protocol, which is a widely-applied protocol in the implemented IoT schemes. This protocol does not guarantee secure and reliable native authentication mechanisms requested by developers. Thus, this paper proposes an authentication scheme via blockchain-based smart contracts for MQTT. This proposal enables the authentication of devices in the IoT network by preserving client security and privacy to ensure trust and accountability through Ethereum-based smart contracts. This review article intends to express the security challenges of this issue as well as its proposed solution in the form of a general description of the work. © 2022 IEEE.},

abstract={Block Chain is an emerging technology which includes a number of features by default such as, distributed ledger, decentralised storage, authentication, security, and traceability. In health sector, patient data are sensitive andit is very essential to be secured, which can be done using blockchain technology. Exchange of healthcare data between hospitals is limited by privacy and dependency on centralized data management systems. Such a centralised storage can be a concern since it can lead to data leakage, data manipulation, mistrust, and single point of failure. Blockchain offers a decentralised computing and storage solution that can help with these issues. It includes smart contracts, identity verification and more. Integrating block chain technology with identity management will be the solution for some issues, such as centralized governing of identities. This system proposes Ethereum based blockchain data management for healthcare application, to store and review the patient record by web application allowing only identity verified users like patient, doctors, family members and hospital staff to have the secure access to health information. Ethereum currently uses a proof-of-work consensus mechanism. Solidity is the popular language for writing Ethereum smart contracts. The data on Ethereum blockchain is stored using tire data structures to manage temporary and permanent data. To protect data integrity, ownership, and permissions, smart contracts are created. Since the business can be handled by smart contracts, there won't be a need for centralised authority to oversee and authorise it, which will cut costs. © 2022 IEEE},

abstract={Social Internet of Vehicle (SIoV) has emerged as one of the most promising applications for vehicle communication, which provides safe and comfortable driving experience. It reduces traffic jams and accidents, thereby saving public resources. However, the wrongly communicated messages would cause serious issues, including life threats. So it is essential to ensure the reliability of the message before acting on considering that. Existing works use cryptographic primitives like threshold authentication and ring signatures, which incurs huge computation and communication overheads, and the ring signature size grew linearly with the threshold value. Our objective is to keep the signature size constant regardless of the threshold value. This work proposes MuSigRDT, a multisignature contract based data transmission protocol using Schnorr digital signature. MuSigRDT provides incentives, to encourage the vehicles to share correct information in real-time and participate honestly in SIoV. MuSigRDT is shown to be secure under Universal Composability (UC) framework. The MuSigRDT contract is deployed on Ethereum's Rinkeby testnet. © 2022 IEEE.},

abstract={Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) connect all vehicles through wireless channels. They provide extensive real-time traffic information services that improve driving safety and traffic management efficiency. However, VANETs are vulnerable to security attacks because of the open wireless nature of their communication channels. Most security mechanisms for traditional VANETs are centralized and have certain limitations in satisfying security requirements, such as anti-single-point failure, distributed security authentication of messages, and privacy preservation in VANETs. To address these issues, herein, we propose a dual blockchain-assisted conditional privacy-preserving authentication framework and protocol for VANETs. The identity authentication and privacy preservation of vehicles in VANETs can be realized without relying on a centralized trusted third party. The proposed scheme also allows for the conditional tracking of illegal vehicles. The decentralized dynamic revocation of illegal vehicles can be realized through smart contracts, rendering the scheme efficient and scalable. We implement this scheme in an Ethereum test network to demonstrate its feasibility and conduct an in-depth security analysis and comprehensive performance evaluation of the proposed scheme. The results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is an effective solution for the development of a decentralized authentication system for VANETs. IEEE},

abstract={Smart grids, as all other IoT applications, are subject to numerous security challenges because of their component's constrained nature, namely smart meters, which are the weakest link in the network. Although several researchers have tried to solve the authentication issues, they did not provide a complete solution that ensures, at the same time, integrity, availability, and confidentiality of the authentication data and allows the mobility of the smart meters. The new architecture proposed in this article aims to strengthen the authentication process by adding blockchain and artificial intelligence to the current one. The artificial intelligence algorithms implemented in the MDMS server allow the detection of authentication fraud and therefore deny access. Moreover, in addition to storing the authentication data in an immutable ledger, the decentralized nature of the blockchain allows smart meters to connect to any MDMS server belonging to the cluster. The authentication policy is implemented in the smart contract and executed by the blockchain nodes. The other architecture components, namely, the smart meters and the MDMS servers, interact with this smart contract through transactions. The article also introduces the concept of the smart meter reputation, which prevents the authentication of a malicious smart meter. The smart contract used for this purpose is implemented on the remix as Ethereum integrated development environment. The simulation tests have shown the architecture's robustness and resistance against different attacks. © 2022 IEEE.},

abstract={The emergence of blockchain decentralization has garnered considerable interest from the scientific and scholarly communities since it addresses scalability issues and provides security for its users. Since its inception, numerous encryption methods have adopted its methodology to develop medically applicable schemes. However, most proposed schemes involve time-consuming operations, while others rely on standard pairing libraries. Both approaches cause complexity delays, affecting the blockchain’s execution speed. In the case of blockchain digital signatures, participants’ cryptographic keys are tied to their assets instead of their identities. This contradicts the non-repudiation feature of public key digital signatures. Therefore, this article proposes a lightweight hybrid encryption protocol employing the key encapsulation technique to generate encapsulated keys for blockchain network participants. The proposed method allows users to generate encapsulated keys linked to their identities. In order to increase the speed of cryptographic execution on the blockchain, we evaluate the computational overhead of the proposed model using the pairing Ethereum library (Py-eth library). In addition, the Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) library measures the consumption of gas costs on the blockchain. Our performance analysis demonstrates that the proposed protocol achieves a lower computational cost with less gas consumption, accelerating blockchain transaction executions. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={One of the most sought-after properties in supply chains is traceability. Traceability involves knowing where a product has been and what happened to it, helping to establish product authenticity. Current traceability solutions focus on generating and storing data but do not verify whether the stored data is correct. In this short paper, we address such a limitation. We do so by introducing forward traceability: an extension of standard traceability definitions with correctness as an additional feature, making forward traceability well-suited for real-time counterfeit detection. We also provide an implementation of forward traceability in a decentralised system in the Solidity language, which we tested on the Ethereum platform. Our proof-of-concept is available on GitHub. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Decentralization and on-chain data Immutability, two of the primary characteristics of blockchain, drive the further technological development as well as effectively reduce the cooperation cost in present era of artificial intelligence. In this paper, an image copyright authentication scheme is proposed on the basis of Ethereum to avoid the watermarking embedding or third-party organizations’ certification in traditional image copyright authentication mechanism. Firstly, image summary descriptions are calculated through the Secure Hash Algorithm 3(SHA-3) and stored subsequently in blockchain by means of smart contracts. Then, the ownership of the image is certified by timestamp on the blockchain. Besides, with the consideration of multiple and repeated transactions of image copyright, a new image copyright authentication traceable model is proposed to enable the image authentication and traceability by identifying every user-held timestamp from the very beginning when the image is generated to the last deal. Finally, our proposed scheme has been realized on Ganache, a fast and convenient Ethereum construction platform where the smart contracts have been tested and modified for many times. Simulation results show that the Ethereum based image copyright authentication scheme proposed in this paper is capable of effectively protecting the copyright of the image and tracking the source on the blockchain. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={In vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs), a vehicle must be authenticated to ensure its messages’ correctness. The authentication mechanism should be privacy-preserving to protect the vehicle’s real identity. However, an authenticated vehicle may misbehave, which forms the basis for certificate revocation lists (CRLs) requirement. But, the CRLs need a large storage and communication overhead. The difficulties like the huge computation overhead, the heavy burden of storing and managing pseudo-identities, and handling ever-increasing certificate revocation makes the existing authentication schemes impracticable. To overcome these difficulties, we propose a hybrid blockchain-based conditional privacy-preserving authentication (BCPPA) scheme in VANETs. In BCPPA, vehicles obtain pseudo-identities from the trusted authority that manages the network. A vehicle uses the received pseudo-identities to achieve anonymous authentication and communicate with other network members. The pseudo-identities with encrypted, real identities are both saved into the blockchain to ensure conditional privacy and member revocation. A receiver can verify the sender’s pseudo-identity using the proposed privacy-preserving authentication mechanism. We evaluate the scheme’s performance using the Ethereum blockchain and computing platform. The security analysis and experimental results show that the proposed scheme is effective in providing authentication and privacy and has reduced computation overhead as compared to existing schemes. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Healthcare supply chains have evolved drastically over time, with complex domestic and global networks and interactions spanning across various organizations and entities. This gives rise to numerous challenges related to information and data pertaining to medical devices used within healthcare supply chain, including data integrity, provenance, traceability, and transparency. Counterfeit medical devices are a major obstacle that the healthcare industry is trying to resolve as it poses a huge risk to the safety of its users. Therefore, it is paramount to have an end-to-end system in place that tracks medical devices not only as they move across the supply chain but also as they are purchased and sold online in digital marketplaces. Unfortunately, existing systems follow a centralized architecture, which leads to being a single point of failure and eradicating transparency and authentication. In this paper, we propose a non-fungible token (NFT) based solution that exploits blockchain smart contracts, integrates tokenization protocols, and utilizes a decentralized storage system for a reliable and efficient medical devices traceability system and ownership management solution. In our proposed system, NFTs are used to represent the digital twin of the medical device. This digital twin captures the medical device attributes and its relevant metadata during its life cycle from production, manufacturing, distribution and movement, to current use and ownership. We present the system architecture and implementation details, along with tested algorithms that define the various functions of our smart contracts. The paper also presents testing details and analyses the solution's feasibility through a cost and security analysis. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Authentication while maintaining anonymity when availing a service over the internet is a significant privacy challenge. Anonymous credentials (AC) address this by providing the user with a credential issued by a trusted entity that convinces the service provider (SP) that the user is authenticated but reveals no other information. The existing AC schemes assume a single trusted authority (certifier) that validates all the user attributes. In practice, however, a user may require different attributes to be attested by different certifiers. This means that the user has to get multiple credentials, increasing the burden on the SP who has to verify each one of them. Moreover, complete anonymity can be misused. We propose a decentralized threshold revocable anonymous credential (DTRAC) scheme over blockchains that supports - a) attestation of attributes by multiple certifiers, and b) anonymity revocation through a set of distributed openers, by integrating threshold opening to the state-of-the-art threshold anonymous credential issuance scheme, Coconut [35]. DTRAC generates a single credential on attributes that are attested by multiple certifiers, freeing the SP from the hassle of verifying multiple credentials. We analyze the security of DTRAC formally in the universal composability (UC) framework. We also implement a prototype on Ethereum using smart contracts and give a detailed analysis of its performance. We compare the verification time for credentials with attributes attested by multiple certifiers in both DTRAC and Coconut and see that in terms of execution time and gas consumption, DTRAC performs significantly better than Coconut. It also scales better, with the performance gain of DTRAC over Coconut increasing linearly with the number of certifiers. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={YouTube connects people with each other through an online video sharing service platform. With the great development of the entertainment industry, content on YouTube is accessible to many people of different ages. However, verifying the content posted on YouTube is clean or not is a difficult problem. Dirty content is violent, pornographic and vulgar content that causes serious psychological harm to the segment of users under the age of 18, i.e., especially those of an age who are not yet aware of the harmful effects of content. Toxic will bring to the child’s behavior. Agree that Google (i.e., YouTube) has developed a YouTube Kid application where the videos are only for children under the age of 13. However, cultural and educational differences between regions strongly influence the choice of children. Select content for children. Therefore, the content restrictions on the YouTube Kid application have not yet met all the requirements of parents around the world. There have been many development directions to identify videos containing malicious content based on deep learning. However, there is no method to build a tool to support parents of children to share and identify videos with objectionable content (e.g., violence, pornography, obscene words) on the YouTube platform. In this research paper, we introduce YVC, a YouTube-verified content platform by applying blockchain’s distributed, public validation. This tool helps parents validate YouTube content and issue a report to reduce dirty content on YouTube. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we implement the proof-of-concept in the three most popular EVM platforms: Ethereum, Fantom, and the Binance smart chain. Compared to the YouTube Kids (i.e., the most common shared video platform for the under 13-year-old kid), our approach is able to capture the video preferences of the parents covering the difference areas/countries. © 2022, International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications.

abstract={In the current digitalized world, the number of interconnected entities is constantly growing. Users and devices are no longer confined to the same physical or geographical region when participating in network connections. Due to this, the line that delimits the network perimeter can no longer be identified. Traditional castle-And-moat security approaches cannot accommodate the latent threats that may occur in these borderless network deployments. Zero Trust Networking, alongside Software Defined Perimeter (SDP) concepts, aims to extend the perimeter of trust to every entity connected to the network regardless of their physical location. Authentication, access control, and verification methods must constantly be applied for all the participants in the network, as everything is considered untrustworthy. The requirement of complex security mechanisms alongside constant trust assurance for every interaction may challenge the realization of the Zero Trust vision. Blockchain is an emergent technology that can be integrated into Zero Trust to leverage these requirements. The data decentralization, anonymity, cryptography, and immutable record of transactions can provide the required security for Zero Trust. In this work, we propose a mechanism for assuring secure service session management with the use of blockchain capabilities. Non-Fungible-Tokens (NFT) are applied to access and provider tokens representing a policy agreement for service consumption. The tokens are mapped to the public addresses of entities registered in the blockchain. The access and provider tokens are encoded with metadata defining the service sessions' expiration. The proposal is realized through the use of an emerging open source Zero Trust platform (OpenZiti), a private Ethereum blockchain (Hyperledger Besu), and a session manager decentralized application (ZT&T) for handling the creation of policies and blockchain interaction. © 2022 IEEE.},

abstract={Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) has been a key part of evolving communication systems in the last few years. However, the life-cycle management of Virtual Network Functions (VNF) is still a not trivial task. Blockchains (BC), due to their decentralization and immutability characteristics, together with the automation provided by Smart Contracts (SC), can be employed to enable such automated and trustworthy VNF management.Thus, this paper proposes VeNiCE to automate the deployment and life-cycle management of VNFs using events emitted on SCs. VeNiCE provides automation and auditability by relying on a BC to provide a decentralized approach for VNF management, which performs management actions, such as VNF deployment and deletion, and based on events and communicates with an SC to provide immutable logging of the VNF life-cycle. VeNiCE provides (i) a frontend for user interaction, (ii) a backend implementing the communication with the NFV framework, and (iii) an SC that emits events, stores VNF allocations, and authenticates users. A prototype of VeNiCE was developed and deployed in the Ethereum BC using OpenStack Tacker as an NFV platform. Experiments were conducted in a real-world deployment of such a prototype to analyze the economic costs of using SCs and the time required to process requests by each component of VeNiCE and the BC. Those results obtained show VeNiCE's feasibility, highlight its benefits achieved with the automation and provide insights on reducing costs by exploring additional BC platforms and different deployment types, which introduce centralization and management concerns. © 2022 IEEE.},

abstract={There are a number of issues that existing authentication systems face in a smart community. These include insufficient authentication efficiency, an inflexible authentication methodology, and an unsecured data exchange server. The dependability and security of the proposed blockchain-based smart home strategy were extensively tested for confidentiality, integrity, and privacy, as well as other factors. In terms of the parameters of classic centralized architecture, blockchain technology is being used in the data storage and exchange blocks. To ensure data integrity both inside and outside of the smart home network, it is necessary to ensure that all users present in the network are authenticated. The network under consideration is built on the Ethereum platform. The performance measures to be considered were accuracy, security, and response time. The experimental results reveal that our proposed technique outperforms currently available techniques in terms of overall performance. In particular, when compared to other state-of-the-art systems, our proposed system has the highest accuracy of 96% and generates a stronger output in the second stage when compared to centralized architecture with an accuracy of 71%, representing a 25% difference in terms of improving the accuracy of smart homes. © 2022 IEEE.},

abstract={KYC or Know Your Customer is the procedure to verify the individuality of its consumers & evaluating the possible dangers of illegitimate trade relations. A few problems with the existing KYC manual process are that it is less secure, time-consuming and expensive. With the advent of Blockchain technology, its structures such as consistency, security, and geographical diversity make them an ideal solution to such problems. Although marketing solutions such as KYC-chain.co, K-Y-C. The legal right to enable blockchain-based KYC authentication provides a way for documents to be verified by a trusted network participant. This project uses an ETHereum based Optimised KYC Block-chain system with uniform A-E-S encryption and compression built on the LZ method. The system publicly verifies a distributed encryption, is protected by cryptography, operates by pressing the algorithm and is all well-designed blockchain features. The suggested scheme is a novel explanation based on Distributed Ledger Technology or Blockchain technology that would cut KYC authentication process expenses of organisations& decrease the regular schedule for completion of the procedure whilst becoming easier for clients. The largest difference in the system in traditional methods is the full authentication procedure is performed in just no time for every client, regardless of the number of institutions you desire to be linked to. Furthermore, since DLT is employed, validation findings may be securely distributed to consumers, enhancing transparency. Based on this method, a Proof of Concept (POC) is produced with Ethereum's API, websites as endpoints and the android app as the front office, recognising the viability and efficacy of this technique. Ultimately, this strategy enhances consumer satisfaction, lowers budget overrun & promotes transparency in the customer transport network. © 2022 IEEE.},

abstract={Health care interoperability unfolds the way for personalized health care services at a reduced cost. Furthermore, a decentralized system holds the promise to prevent compromises such as cyber-attacks due to data breaches. Hence, there is a need for a framework that seamlessly integrates and shares data across the system stakeholders. We propose SEquestered aNd SynergIstic BLockchain Ecosystem (SENSIBLE), a blockchain-powered, knowledge-driven data-sharing framework that gives patients complete control of their medical history and can extract rich information hidden in it using knowledge graphs (KGs). By incorporating both blockchain and KGs, we can provide a platform for secure data sharing among stakeholders by maintaining data privacy and integrity through data authentication and robust data integration. We present a Proof-of-Concept of the SENSIBLE network with Ethereum to share dynamic knowledge across stakeholders. Dynamic knowledge generation on the blockchain provides a two-fold advantage of cooperation and communication amongst the stakeholders in the health care ecosystem. This leads to operational ease through sharing relevant portions of complex information while also ensuring the isolation of sensitive medical data. © 2022 The Authors.

abstract={Zero Trust Networking (ZTN) is a security model where no entity in a network infrastructure is trusted. The first bastion of security for achieving ZTN is to have strong identity verification. Several standard methods for assuring a robust identity exist (E.g., OAuth2.0, OpenID Connect). These standards employ the use of JSON Web Tokens (JWT) during the authentication process. However, the use of JWT for One Time Token (OTT) enrollment has a latent security issue. A JWT can be intercepted by a third party and the information of the payload can be exposed, revealing the details of the enrollment server. Furthermore, an intercepted JWT could be used for enrollment by an impersonator as long as the JWT remains active. Our proposed mechanism aims to secure the ownership of the OTT by including the JWT as encrypted metadata into a Non-Fungible Token (NFT). The mechanism uses the blockchain Public Key of the intended owner for encrypting the JWT, and the blockchain assures the JWT ownership by mapping it to the intended owner's blockchain public address. Our proposed mechanism is applied to an emerging Zero Trust framework (OpenZiti) alongside a permissioned Ethereum blockchain using Hyperledger Besu. The Zero Trust Framework provides the enrollment functionality, while our proposed mechanism based on blockchain and NFT assures the secure distribution of OTTs that is used for the enrollment of identities. © 2022 IEICE.},

abstract={In this paper, a blockchain-based trusted authentication model is proposed to secure the civil aviation ground-to-air communication. Considering the limited bandwidth and high latency of ground-air communication, the Interplanetary File System (IPFS) is used to store avionics equipment information and server equipment information before the plane takes off. Through hash calculation, a unique hash value is obtained as the identity credential for each communication to authenticate. Obtain the key and address of each entity from Ethereum, and realize the registration of avionics system and server information by designing and writing Ethereum smart contracts, as well as the creation of certificates for the avionics system. During the flight, each ground-air communication needs to be signed with a private key for the sent information, and the public key is uploaded to the blockchain trusted storage. In addition, the server authenticates the signature and the result of the interplanetary file system query, and the smart contract authenticates the certificate to ensure that only avionics devices in the trusted domain with verified certificates can take up normal ground-to-air communication between the ground server and the onboard server. The simulation experimental results show that the model can achieve secure ground-to-air communication with low communication overhead and achieve trusted authentication of the avionics devices in communication. © 2022 IEEE.},

abstract={The advancement of technology brings an extensive use of Internet of things (IoT) devices in our daily life. IoT primary used for data collection and provide real-time management information in the network paradigms such as Edge Computing and Fog Computing. However, assuring the reliability of data delivered via Edge Computing is a challenging task. Blockchain has been a technology that has gained traction in recent years. Using Blockchain with IoT allows Smart Cities (SC) applications to spread security information, which protects against Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) attacks. IoT devices in a SC can have a lengthy life, increasing the possibility of security flaws caused by obsolete firmware. This paper will highlight the significance of the implementation considering the SC and demonstrate a testbed made up of Blockchain Ethereum and actual IoT devices. The effects of transmission time, memory, and CPU use on the sending also processing of these messages were demonstrated. The proposed Application Programming Interface (API) sign, identify, and validate the messages before collecting them for an IoT data management application. © 2022 IEEE.},

abstract={Decentralized applications have evolved in the recent past. Many sectors have shown focus towards the Decentralized applications. This paper extends the application to the education sector. The work is associated with the creation of a Decentralized Application on the Ethereum Blockchain, which includes the decentralized way of storing data such as the student details. Face detection feature has been incorporated to tackle the problem of proxy attendance and other malpractices. The Decentralized Application interacts with the smart contract written on the Ethereum network. The smart contract created involves in storing the details of the student's education timeline, such as his/ her marks, institution information, etc. Cloud technology has been used to store large files which cannot be stored in the smart contracts. Many natural calamities and other causes have led to the destruction of the stored details in the traditional databases, these problems have been overcome with this use of Cloud technology, where it provides features like replicability to avoid loses, reliability to avoid failures, scalability to avoid shortage of resources, etc. Authentication has been addressed with the help of face recognition tool which detects the identity of a person. This attempt of solving the above problems have been stated in this paper. Addition of a security layer with face recognition, storage of media files in the AWS S3 cloud, and interaction with the Decentralized Application, makes this paper unique from the other papers. © 2022 IEEE.},

abstract={Regulating illegal activities in cyberspace to balance user privacy and cyberspace governance has been a non-trivial challenge when designing anonymous authentication solutions. For example, while several existing anonymous authentication protocols support accountability, they either risk leaking users&#x0027; private keys or incur significant overhead for accountability in each ongoing authentication, including in cloud service-based authentication schemes. Seeking to address these limitations, this paper proposes an auditable anonymous user authentication (A2UA) protocol based on blockchain for cloud services. The A2UA protocol mainly employs bilinear pairing, partial authentication factors, dynamic credits and fake-public keys (FPKs) to achieve anonymous mutual authentication between users and cloud service providers, and applies ring signature and blockchain to accomplish two-level accountability while maintaining user privacy. Our analysis results show that the A2UA protocol outperforms several other existing schemes in terms of security, computation and communication costs as well as security and privacy features. Additionally, it has good feasibility in terms of the Ethereum Gas cost as demonstrated in our evaluation. IEEE},

abstract={With a growing number of institutions involved in the global education market, it has become increasingly challenging to verify the authenticity of academic achievements such as CVs and diplomas. Blockchain is an enabling technology that can play a key role in solving this problem. This study introduces a blockchain-based achievement record system that produces a verifiable record of achievements. The proposed system aims to facilitate the process of authentication and validation of certificates reliably, easily and quickly, leveraging the unique capabilities offered through Blockchain technology (public Ethereum Blockchain) and smart contracts. We present the design and implementation of the system and its components and tools. We then evaluate the system through a number of studies to measure the system’s; usability, effectiveness, performance, and cost. A System Usability Scale (SUS) test gave a scale of 77.1. Through a literature survey we demonstrate that this system is a significant improvement on legacy systems, being both more user-friendly and more efficient. We also conduct a detailed cost analysis and discuss the positives and limitations of alternative blockchain solutions. Copyright © 2022 by SCITEPRESS – Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

abstract={While blockchain has been an innovative and disruptive technology across many different domains, one area in which is has proven to be particularly game changing is in steganography. Steganography offers data privacy by hiding the existence of data, a property that is distinct from confidentiality (i.e. data existence is known but access is restricted) and authenticity (data existence is known but manipulation is restricted). Combinations of the latter two properties are common in analyses such as Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD), yet there is a lack of research combining such guarantees with steganography. In this work, we introduce the security definition of Authenticated Stegotext with Associated Data (ASAD) which captures steganographic properties even when there is contextual information provided alongside the hidden data. Furthermore, we present a real-world stego-embedding scheme, Authenticated SteGotex with Associated tRansaction Data (ASGARD), that leverages a blockchain-based application as a medium for sending hidden data. We analyze ASGARD in our framework, demonstrating that it meets Level-4 ASAD security. © 2022 IEEE.},

abstract={The development of the cloud plays a wide role in commencing secured communication among users. However, privacy and managing large databases is a major problem in a cloud model. This affects the data sharing due to a lack of trust amongst the stakeholders. Thus, we proposed a new blockchain-assisted authentication and access control technique to provide reliable data integrity verification between the cloud owners and the requester without relying on end-users. The proposed blockchain-based authentication and access control mechanism effectively increases the throughput and reduces the cost by addressing the issues of failure in the cloud model. This method integrates the Interplanetary File System (IPFS) and Ethereum blockchain for sharing the data effectively between the cloud owner and the requester. This framework distributes the secret key to the requester and the data is encrypted by adapting data policies to attain access controls over data. The keyword search function on ciphertext is executed on the basis of smart contract and Ethereum blockchain. The proposed Blockchain-based access control and authentication mechanism obtained better results with a genuine user detection rate of 95%, maximum search accuracy of 95%, and minimum responsiveness of 2.25 sec for 500 Blockchain size. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Agriculture is confronted with several significant difficulties, such as rising air temperatures and population growth, causing the implementation of smart farming operations as an optimum solution. This research aims to contribute to the growing knowledge of the potential role of blockchain technology in promoting the concept of smart farming by enhancing the efficiency of farming operations by boosting agricultural production, lowering environmental impact, and automating the work of farmers. It proposes a secure blockchain-based framework to establish trust among smart farming users. The framework utilizes asymmetric key exchange mechanism using an ECC authentication algorithm and SHA-256 hash function cryptography to secure communication between sensors and drones in the farm field. The SHA-256 hashing function ensures data integrity as attempts to tamper with data result in a different hash value, breaking the chain of blocks. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed framework, a proof-of-concept implementation was developed on the Ethereum blockchain, in which smart contracts were used to model the framework operations. The proof of concept's performance was examined using Hyperledger Caliper for latency, throughput, and transaction success rate. The findings clearly indicate that blockchain technology can provide an efficient and scalable mechanism to advance smart farming and address some of the barriers that inhibit smart farming, particularly regarding to data integrity and availability. © 2022 Kahlid S.

abstract={Security in the communication systems rely mainly on a trusted Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and Certificate Authorities (CAs). Besides the lack of automation, the complexity and the cost of assigning a signed certificate to a device, several allegations against CAs have been discovered, which has created trust issues in adopting this standard model for secure systems. The automation of the servers certificate assignment was achieved by the Automated Certificate Management Environment (ACME) method, but without confirming the trust of assigned certificate. This paper presents a complete tested and implemented solution to solve the trust of the Certificates provided to the servers by using the blockchain platform for certificate validation. The Blockchain network provides an immutable data store, holding the public keys of all domain names, while resolving the trust concerns by applying an automated Blockchain-based Domain Control Validation (B-DCV) for the server and client server verification. The evaluation was performed on the Ethereum Rinkeby testnet adopting the Proof of Authority (PoA) consensus algorithm which is an improved version of Proof of Stake (Po S) applied on Ethereum 2.0 providing superior performance compared to Ethereum 1.0. © 2022 IEEE.},

abstract={In the Internet of Battlefield Things (IoBT), users and sensor-equipped entities send multiple messages to the Command Control Center (CCC) over the network. The authentication and integrity of these messages are crucial because if an adversary or malicious node transmits, alters, or replays these messages, the consequences will be disasters. Current centralized authentication systems are not suitable for the distributed environment because such schemes are prone to a single point of failure, privacy, and scalability issues. Moreover, the high communication overhead caused by centralization increases energy consumption. In this work, we propose a technique called Blockchain-based Autonomous Authentication and Integrity for the Internet of Battlefield Things (BIoBT) for the C3I system. The proposed technique does not require an explicit authentication channel for the authentication of entities because it is performed on the blockchain side when receiving the data. In addition, it provides data integrity and non-repudiation. BIoBT prototype is created, deployed, and tested on the Ethereum test network. The results prove that BIoBT is efficient, cost-effective, and satisfies the security requirements of a distributed environment for IoBT. BIoBT also outperforms contemporary mechanisms in terms of the number of messages required to establish a secure channel, thereby reducing communication overhead and resource consumption. Author},

abstract={Identity Management Systems (IdMS) have seemingly evolved in recent years, both in terms of modelling approach and in terms of used technology. The early centralized, later federated and user-centric Identity Management (IdM) was finally replaced by Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI). Solutions based on Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) appeared, with prominent examples of uPort, Sovrin or ShoCard. In effect, users got more freedom in creation and management of their identities. IdM systems became more distributed, too. However, in the area of interoperability, dynamic and ad-hoc identity management there has been almost no significant progress. Quest for the best IdM system which will be used by all entities and organizations is deemed to fail. The environment of IdM systems is, and in the near future will still be, heterogenous. Therefore a person will have to manage her or his identities in multiple IdM systems. In this article authors argument that future-proof IdM systems should be able to interoperate with each other dynamically, i.e. be able to discover existence of different identities of a person across multiple IdM systems, dynamically build trust relations and be able to translate identity assertions and claims across various IdM domains. Finally, authors introduce identity relationship model and corresponding identity discovery algorithm, propose IdMS-agnostic identity discovery service design and its implementation with use of Ethereum and Smart Contracts. © 2022 IEEE.},

abstract={In recent years, decentralized global ID systems have attracted significant attention. The concept of self-sovereign identity was established to realize a decentralized global ID, which is achieved by verifiable credentials and decentralized identifiers. However, there is a problem in using such decentralized global IDs for various remote services from the viewpoint of flexibility. In this paper, we propose a system which can give an "attribute"to global IDs dynamically by using only the basic function of a blockchain (i.e., using cryptocurrency transfer only). The main idea of our scheme is that an "attribute token"is assigned to global IDs or removed from global IDs using the token transmission function in a blockchain. Thus, we can set the credibility level and decentralization level of global IDs adaptively, and thus, we manage global IDs securely and flexibly. Furthermore, we conduct feasibility experiments with the proposed system and realize an attribute token assignment in Bitcoin and Ethereum cryptocurrencies. This result shows that our system can use almost all blockchain systems having a token transmission function. © 2022 IEEE.},

abstract={The development of blockchain has promoted the prosperity of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. The majority of cryptocurrencies are ERC20 tokens implemented based on Ethereum contracts. The major role of ERC20 tokens is to carry out various trades and loans in decentralized applications (DApps). To participate in DApps, users must grant the DApps permission to spend tokens on user behalf. However, if the authorization logic of token contract is flawed implementation, the holder of token will suffer tremendous financial losses. In this work, we detect the authentication implementation of the flaws in ERC20 token, which has not been done before. We find the authentication process of the token is implemented by operating the authentication data structure of the token. Therefore, we capture the operations of the authentication data structure in token contract to infer authentication behaviors and detect authentication defects. However, it's not a simple task as most smart contracts are not open source and the bytecode of token contract lacks type information. To tackle these problems, we utilize symbolic execution on the token bytecode, then identify the authentication data structure and capture the operations by parsing the symbolic expressions, and finally detect authentication defects through the inferred authentication behavior. To best our knowledge, this is the first work to detect the flaws in the implementation of authentication in ERC20 Token. To automate the analysis, we implement our approach in a new tool named TokenCat and use it to inspect 245,822 tokens. As a result, the TokenCat found 491 ERC20 token authentication implementation flaws with 94% precision. © 2022 IEEE.},

abstract={The election is one of the factors due to which democracy fails as a system in place. Today, countries like India, the US, and even Japan are still facing accusations like vote rigging, lack of transparency, and hacking of EVMs. The latest election held in India, even in a situation like this pandemic, has led us to question whether our government parties are not concerned about people's well-being in their fight for power or are simply turning a deaf ear to the issue. Voting is one of the core pillars of democracy. There have been continual attempts to improve the methodology and procedures for achieving a valid, open voting system. E-voting was one the solutions for solving some issues but due to security and privacy concerns, it was not widely adopted. Blockchain technology is an emerging, decentralized technology that is promising to improve various aspects of many industries. The solution to alleviate current problems in E-voting might be to extend E-voting further into blockchain technology. An Ethereum blockchain-based decentralized voting system, named MYVOTE that protects individual voter privacy and improves accessibility while ensuring fairness, protection, and cost-efficiency, is proposed in this paper. The system also preserves the confidentiality and ease of access of the individual voter while maintaining transparency, security, and efficiency in the voting process. The strong authentication mechanism is inculcated to ensure the authenticity of system. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Two-factor authentication (2FA) is commonly used in Internet of Things (IoT) authentication to provide multi-layer protection. Tokens, often known as One-Time Passwords (OTP), are used to offer additional information. While this technique provides flexible verification and an additional layer of security, it still has a number of security issues. This is because it relies on third-party services to produce tokens or OTPs, which leads to serious information leakage issues. Additionally, relying on a third party to provide authentication tokens significantly increases the risk of exposure and attacks, as tokens can be stolen via Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attacks. In trying to rectify this issue, in this paper, we propose and develop a blockchain-based two-factor authentication method for web-based access to sensor data. The proposed method provides a lightweight and user-centric authentication that makes use of Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts technologies. Then we provided performance and security analysis of our system. Based on the evaluation results, our method has proven to be effective and has the ability to facilitate reliable authentication. © 2022 IEEE.},

abstract={In recent years, the spread of information and communication technology has led to the emergence of e-government, which is the electronic replacement of government services. E-government is said to be compatible with blockchain technology, which has led to various studies on the possibility. Notarization, one of the functions of the government, has particularly been examined for the potential adoption of blockchain technology. However, because the notary public must authenticate the document's contents during the notarization process, they have been difficult to replace with smart contracts. In this study, we focus only on fixed date notarizations and propose a fully automated notarization system by combining a national eID card with Public Key Infrastructure and smart contracts. A fixed date is a notarization that allows a notary public to guarantee that a document existed, regardless of the authenticity of the document's content. Therefore, it can be replaced by a smart contract. Specifically, our proposed system automatically authenticates the creator and the document for electronic documents signed with a national eID card and uses the transaction receipt generated when the information is stored on the blockchain as a certificate of notarization. Verification of the signed data is done inside the blockchain by smart contracts, which eliminates the need for a verification authority. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in a Japanese use case as proof of concept. © 2022 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper reports the use of the Schnorr Digital Signature as a new alternative instead of the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) currently used in Ethereum. Elliptic curve cryptography, which is the cryptographic background of blockchain digital signature, is explained in the background and related works. This study then examined, the problems facing ECDSA and how the Schnorr Digital Signature could solve them. The test was performed by comparing Schnorr and ECDSA implemented in a private Ethereum network environment. The performance results showed that Schnorr Digital Signature has strengths in terms of efficiency over ECDSA. The efficiency deals with the gas price, signature size, block size, block elapsed time, and signature algorithm calculation time. © 2022 Institute of Electronics and Information Engineers.

abstract={Internet of Things(IoT) has become a major component of our lives, where numerous independent devices connect, communicate and interact with one another. It is an evolving technology where devices are intelligent, independent and exchange information with one another without the need for human intervention. Hence these devices must identify, authenticate each other and ensure data integrity and security to avoid being targeted by various malicious attacks. To overcome these limits, a secure decentralized system has been proposed in this work. Here devices can create secure clusters along with security features provided by blockchains, where devices can identify, authenticate and trust each other for data integrity and availability. The implementation of proposed work is done using java and python language and also using ethereum blockchain. Initially, there was only one mode of communication where devices belonging to the same cluster could communicate with each other which are termed as Intra cluster communication. In the proposed system, major focus is on the Inter cluster communication where devices belonging to different clusters can communicate with each other. By using inter cluster communication, the performance and availability of data for the application are enhanced. The results obtained in the proposed work will satisfy the security, efficiency, and low cost needs of the Internet of Things. © 2022 IEEE.},

abstract={Security and privacy issues have become a major hindrance to the broad adoption of Ride-Hailing Services (RHSs). In this paper, we introduce a new collusion attack initiated by the Ride-Hailing Service Provider (RHSP) and a driver that could easily link the real riders and their anonymous requests (credentials). Besides this attack, existing work requires heavy computations to execute user matching, and it is challenging for riders to verify matching results. Meanwhile, a malicious driver may cancel an assigned ride order due to its short distance. To address these issues, we present a RHS system named Nereus to support collusion resistance, efficiency, verifiability, and accountability. First, we integrate a smart contract into a Software Guard Extensions (SGX) enclave to establish a <italic>private smart contract</italic> for collusion resistance. We use a Bloom filter to achieve efficient matching. Second, we leverage privacy-preserving range query and Merkle proofs to make matching results verifiable. Meanwhile, we adopt short group signatures to provide anonymous authentication and deposit commitments to hold the runaway driver accountable. We formally state and prove the security and privacy of Nereus. We build a prototype based on Ethereum and SGX to conduct extensive performance analysis in regard to gas costs, computational costs, and communication overhead. Experimental results show that Nereus significantly improves over existing schemes in terms of computational costs. IEEE},

abstract={By the development and advancement of blockchain technique, Internet of Things (IoT) proliferation driven devices and the application of blockchain-enabled IoT alter the view and operating infrastructure of the smart networks. The blockchain is responsible for supporting decentralized systems and offers secured means of authentication, management, and access to IoT system thereby deploying smart contracts offered by Ethereum. The increasing demand and the blockchain expansion generate huge volume of sensitive data. The growing demand and expansion of blockchain-IoT systems is generating large volume of sensitive data. Furthermore, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks are regarded as the most promising threats for smart contracts in the blockchain-based systems. Therefore, there is a need to detect and classify the attack type and the data should be stored in server more securely with the use of blockchain and data aggregation method. For this purpose, this presented technique aims at introducing decentralized consensus blockchain and Interplanetary file system (IPFS) based data aggregation for effective classification and data storage. The attack is detected using meta-hyperparameter random forest (MHP-RF) classifier. Once the attack is detected, the transaction information is stored in server securely by means of smart contract-based blockchain system. The transaction handling stage classifies the transaction type as normal or abnormal one which then followed by execution of business logic by smart contract thereby appending the transaction of blockchain in the network cloud. The consensus blockchain technique is employed with the use of PoW-enabled scheme integrated with Elgamal-based data aggregation. Therefore, the system security is improved and the intrusion is prevented greatly. The performance analysis of the system is analyzed in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, F-score, Encryption time, decryption time, execution time, and space complexity. The attained outcomes are compared with traditional approaches to prove the effectiveness of proposed strategy. The proposed system is said to be effective in time consumption, classifier performance, and in overcoming space complexity issues. © 2022 G. Subathra et al.},

abstract={This paper presents an implementation which uses decentralized technologies such as blockchain and IPFS on the issuance and management of the academic certificates. The focus is on improving the actual process, as well as increasing integrity and trustworthiness of ownership of those certificates. The prototype we have developed is called BCert and its purpose is to add the certificates to blockchain network and to offer the possibility to verify them and make accessible to the potential stakeholders. It will also be used to verify that it is possible to upload a minimum of 32 certificates at one time and to evaluate speed of upload. BCert will aim to make the deployment and verification of those certificates quick, fast, secure, and efficient. It uses IPFS (Interplanetary File System) to have private logs and to increase efficiency. Additionally, based on the Technology Transfer concept, we predicted a model related to the launch of the technology to the market. The study was conducted online with 421 responses chosen randomly from several public and private universities in Albania and in Western Balkans. © 2022 Croatian Society MIPRO.},

abstract={With the healthcare system's ongoing digital transformation and the need for patient data sharing to become an essential step to understanding the patient's health history, cyber security must stay at the forefront and be made a top priority. As a result, most existing data-sharing systems depend on trusted third parties. As a result, these systems lack interoperability, data fragmentation, integrity, security, and privacy. In our previous work, we designed a framework based on Blockchain to secure patient health records exchange(SPHRS) that is fully controlled by the patient in terms of revoking or granting access and creating access policies for care providers. The framework achieves security by using smart contracts for user identity authentication and verification. The distributed IPFS storage is applied to store the encrypted patient health records and ensure immutability. In addition, NuCypher software takes advantage of a proxy re-encryption protocol to store the encryption and decryption keys securely. In this study, we assess the framework's performance by testing metrics such as blockchain transactions' gas consumption, throughput, Average response time, and average. Bytes. Furthermore, the security of the framework is discussed. SPHRS demonstrates how we can establish a novel approach to efficiently secure patient health record sharing. However, it shows a promising result that can potentially transform the digital patient healthcare system. © 2022 IEEE.},

abstract={Software can be described, like human users and other objects, through attributes. For this work, we define software attributes as humanly verifiable, falsifiable, or judgeable statements regarding characteristics of said software. Much like attributes in general, software attributes require robust identities for their source but also for their target, meaning a software in general or a binary in particular. As software can be of critical importance, performing an independent review of attribute claims appears beneficial. We posit that decentralized platforms that were developed and refined over the past decade can bridge the gap between existing tools and methods for software review and their open, transparent, and accountable use for the benefit of users. In this work, we explore the feasibility and implications of decentralizing an independent review of software attribute claims. We envision the decentralization of a review process from initialization and execution to the persistent recording of results. We sketch the available design space by decomposing the overall process into a modular design and describe how each component covers overarching objectives. To illustrate practical implications and tradeoffs, we present ETHDPR, a proof of concept implementation based on Ethereum and IPFS. Through a quantitative and qualitative evaluation, we show that a decentralized software review is practically feasible. We illustrate the flexibility of the proposed approach using a toy example of a software component in automotive systems. Lastly, we provide a discussion on fundamental limits and open issues of facilitating independent reviews via technological means. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Blockchain technologies and Internet of Things (IoT) are being tremendously applied in many fields, especially for e-healthcare. For the safe, secure delivery of healthcare data management, there must be miraculous support for applying applications of blockchain. Patients’ privacy and security are becoming a worry as the number of IoT devices in the healthcare system grows at an exponential rate. IoT devices can provide real-time sensory data like clinical trials, device tracking, health insurance details of patients for better tracking and pharmaceutical tracing. In IoT, the problem arises when there is manipulation of data or tampering of data or any point of failure, especially in healthcare. A blockchain is a form of the ledger; which consists of distributed records that are unmodifiable and transparent through replicating among public/private networks. Because of its competency and convenience for people’s lifestyles, the mobile healthcare system is receiving a lot of attention. This paper examines an overview of the blockchain-based authentication technologies, as well as answers to security concerns and developments in healthcare via blockchain and IoT integration. Also, discuss the applications of blockchain in e-healthcare to design decentralized IoT-based e-healthcare systems, methods, statistics, and success cases applied. Further, this paper prepares the challenges of blockchain-based smart healthcare systems. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={This paper provides a solution to the educational certification issue by employing the blockchain network. The proposed permissioned blockchain network is implemented in hyperledger fabric. The proposed system provides various services to issuing institutions: verifying organisation; identification and authentication of the issuer; verify and securely share academic records to the recipients; and stores the academic records in the blockchain in a distributed manner, ensuring the privacy of stored records of the recipient. When compared to Ethereum, hyperledger fabric provides additional functionalities like efficient parallelism, concurrency, multiple transaction executions, and efficient commitments of the transaction into the ledger. The experimental analysis of the proposed system has been executed to test the performance of invoking and query transactions using Hyperledger Caliper. We analyse the throughput and transaction latency of the proposed work as well. The experimental results exhibit the proposed system achieves better transaction processing power and security compared to existing systems. Copyright © 2022 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={In recent years, counterfeit products have played an important role in the product making industry. It has also affected the company's brand, sales, and profits. Blockchain technology is now being used to identify authentic products and detect counterfeits. Blockchain is a distributed, expanded, digital book that stores business data as blocks in multiple archives linked by chains. No block can be changed or modified because blockchain technology is secure. Customers or users who use the blockchain technology does not have to be depend on mediator to ensure product security of the system. Counterfeit products can be effectively combated using serial numbers which is assigned to the product uniquely. With emerging Blockchain technology trends in this project. As a result, this system can be used to store product information as well as generate distinct product codes for items such as blocks. It generates a unique code for the user and matches it to the Blockchain network. If the input matches, the customer will be notified; if the input does not match, the customer will be notified that the product is counterfeit. © 2022 IEEE.},

abstract={In centralized infrastructures, users are not capable of authenticating themselves, in identity management systems, beyond their application's domain. Users are forced to trust their service providers for identification and data management. Such solutions have experienced large-scale data breaches and are cumbersome for users to remember the credentials for multiple sites. Furthermore, users have very little control over their data. The concept of decentralized identity has raised the possibility of better managing these concerns. It allows users to share only the relevant part of their personal information with a service provider to verify their digital identity. We propose OrgID, a decentralized identity and user-centric data management platform including identity registration and authorization procedures. Our approach supports self-sovereign identity architecture leveraged by blockchain. This method consists of a one-time proof-verification mechanism that facilitates the secure access and credibility of digital information. Moreover, users can maintain their identities associated with specific attributes and rely on a proof mechanism using smart contracts. It deploys a platform where user registration and authorization no longer involve a central service provider. We implemented the proposed solution using smart contracts on a private Ethereum blockchain. We further analyzed the performance of these processes regarding the system's scalability to evaluate how they manage latency and the number of users. The results state that the system is highly scalable to manage a large number of users and the system's latency is adjustable based on the application needs. © 2022 IEEE.},

abstract={User authentication is a measurement challenge for handheld devices and online accounts such as bank accounts, social media accounts etc. because illegal access results in money loss and user privacy. Individual devices, online financial services, and intelligent spaces are three significant areas of concern for customer authentication procedures. Three ways have been identified for authentication factors: i) knowledge-factor, ii) Inherence factor, and iii) possession-factor. This study investigates two-way user authentication through image processing. CNN, RCNN, and Deepface are deep learning algorithms used for image recognition. We used imagechain for image storage and Blockchain for personal information storage (mobile number) to secure the database. The database is stored on an Ethereum-based blockchain. After determining whether the image is fake or real, match the webcam image with the imagechain; if both images match, the one-time password is given to the user’s cellphone number for login access. For image processing, Opencv is employed, and the Python library is used to execute machine and deep learning algorithms for user authentication. Test the proposed model on the 10 to 100 users for authentication. Accuracy of this experiment is 75.35, 76.33, 98.18 and cosine similarities of images are much better between images, but in case of fake image identification it achieved 97.35 % accuracy. © 2022 Taru Publications.},

abstract={Background: The increasing use of various online services requires an efficient digital identity management (DIM) approach. Unfortunately, the original Internet protocols were not designed with built-in identity man-agement, which creates challenges related to privacy, security, and usability. There is an increasing societal concern regarding the management of these sensitive data, access to it, and where it is stored. Blockchain technology can potentially offer a secure solution to address these issues in a decentralized manner without centralized authority. This is important for e-health services where the patient and the healthcare provider often are required to prove their identity. Blockchain technology can be utilized for creating digital identities and making its management easier, thus giving a higher degree of control to the user than what current solutions offer. It can be used to create a digital identity on the blockchain, making it easier for individuals and entities to manage, giving them greater control over who has their personal information and how they handle it. In addition, it might be utilized to create a higher degree of trust and security for e-health applications. Objective: The aim of this research work was to review the state-of-the-art regarding blockchain-based decentralized identity management for healthcare applications. Based on this summary, we provide a viewpoint on how blockchain-based decentralized identity frameworks might be utilized for virtualized healthcare applications. Method: This research study applied a scoping, semi-systematic review approach to summarize the state-of-the-art. Included identity management systems were evaluated based on seven criteria: autonomy, authority, availability, approval, confidentiality, tenacity, and Interoperability. Results: Seven blockchain-based identity management systems were included and evaluated in this work: these include solutions built with Ethereum, Hyperledger Indy, Hyperledger Fabric, Hedera, and Sovrin blockchains. Conclusion: DIM is crucial for virtual health care. Decentralized identity management for healthcare purposes is currently being explored in both academia and the private sector. More work is needed with the aim of improving the efficiency of current DIM solutions and to fully understand what technical frameworks are best suited for e-health applications. © 2022 The Authors.},

abstract={Privacy is playing a crucial role in the smart health industry, where health service providers and their customers use the internet of things (IoT) to provide and consume health services. Preserving privacy for legitimate users and preventing illegitimate users from accessing services are difficult to implement simultaneously. In this study, we addressed this issue by proposing a new healthcare system for IoT based on the blockchain and zero-knowledge succinct noninteractive argument of knowledge (zk-SNARK). We employ the anonymity property of the public blockchain to protect users' privacy. The zk-SNARK scheme works as an anonymous authenticator to prevent unauthorized users from using services. We also analyze the security of the proposed system by showing that it can resist various types of attacks, such as impersonation, collusion, and man-in-the-middle attacks. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the zk-SNARK scheme with respect to computational costs and the interactions with the Ethereum blockchain smart contract with respect to transaction fees. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Data privacy and data availability remain the major concern in centralized cloud storage, which could be handled effectively through the concept of decentralized data storage. However, the secrecy of data sharing is a rising concern in the decentralized data storage for which the effective access control and data sharing scheme, hash and session key-dependent attribute-based encryption (HS-ABE) is proposed in this research. Accordingly, the multi-level access control and sharing strategy authenticates the genuine requestors and assures access to the requestors upon the authentication of their attribute sets. In this perspective of access control and secure data sharing, Ethereum blockchain, decentralized Interplanetary File System (IPFS), HS-ABE are organized. The data owners (DOs) provide the secret attribute set for the requestors ensuring fine-grained access over the data. The performance of the developed HS-ABE scheme is investigated and compared with the conventional strategies, where the memory usage of the proposed scheme is 5812 Kbps, which proclaims a well-defined secure access control and authentication in the Blockchain-based cloud storage. © 2022 IEEE.},

abstract={The new IoT apps will not be able to inspire people to utilize them and may ultimately lose all their potential if an interoperable and trustworthy ecosystem is not provided. IoT has its extra security difficulties such as information storage, administration, privacy concerns, and authentication. The presently deployed IoT apps have encountered various security and privacy assaults globally. Due to being less secure and low powered, the IoT devices present a simple entryway to the adversaries to obtain access to the corporate networks, leading to giving easy control over all of the data of the users. The objective of this doctorate proposed work will be to solve the security associated difficulties in multiple IoT domains like the e-commerce, vehicular ad hoc networks (VANET), mobile ad hoc networks (MANET), and Internet of Drones (IoD). The proposed study focuses on the development of a distributed framework for IoT based on blockchain. The framework includes the usage of Ethereum-based smart contracts and auction models to increase the income and QoS for both the seller and the buyer and the development of a DAG chain-based distributed framework for parking lot allocation in a network of automobiles. The suggested model includes the requirement of obtaining agreement among the nodes with probability one in such a circumstance. The suggested model demonstrates to be predictable as typical voting-based consensus protocols like Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) and at the same time can accommodate a high number of nodes even in an asynchronous setting. Research on Byzantine fault-tolerant systems has been ongoing for more than four decades, and although the solutions were shown to be feasible early on, they remained unworkable for a long time. With PBFT, the first feasible solution was provided in 1999, and this sparked fresh research that has resulted in unique applications that are still being developed today employing this technology. Despite the fact that the safety and liveness properties of PBFT-type protocols have been thoroughly investigated, when it comes to practical performance, only empirical results - often obtained in artificial environments - are known, and imperfections in the communication channels are not explicitly considered. It is our goal in this paper to propose the first performance model for PBFT that takes into account the effect of unreliable channels as well as the usage of alternative transport protocols across those channels. We also performed a large number of simulations to test the model and acquire a better understanding of the influence of different deployment factors on the total transaction timeframe. © 2022 D.

abstract={Due to the quick increase of IoT devices, they lack the authentication standards and administration needed to keep user data secure. Hackers could cause significant infrastructure harm by infiltrating a wide spectrum of IoT devices. Blockchain use in IoT technology guarantees trust and authentication across all IoT elements, resulting in IoT security. Blockchain is a decentralized, distributed, and shared database that enables the creation of decentralized apps. Traceability, openness, immutability, and fault tolerance are some of the qualities of this technology that help maintain data privacy in IoT scenarios and thus create a safe environment. We look at a potential strategy for securely controlling IoT devices,i.e., devices connected to the internet using smart contracts on the blockchain in this study. This paper demonstrates how the proposed system comprising of a blockchain and smart contracts work efficiently in concurrence to avoid tampering by unauthorized parties. We have employed web3 library to control the linked devices by implementing Ethereum nodes (second most popular blockchain) on Raspberry Pi simulations and node.js. © 2022 IEEE.},

abstract={With the popularity of cloud computing, cloud storage, as a part of cloud computing services, has also attracted extensive attention because of its flexibility and low-cost economic expenditure. On the basis of searchable access, this paper combines blockchain with searchable access, and proposes a dynamic verifiable ciphertext retrieval scheme based on blockchain. This scheme is mainly applied to the private cloud environment that needs to ensure the absolute security of data, such as the database of confidential institutions. Through the characteristics of Ethereum account, authorized access control in one to many environment can be realized. Relying on the characteristics of Ethereum, it solves the problem of the correctness of the results returned by the malicious server. And aiming at the problem that the ECS does not update data, this scheme innovatively solves the verification of the returned results during data update by introducing the aggregated message authentication code technology. The scheme also supports forward and backward security to ensure that no privacy will be disclosed during data update. At the same time, experimental tests are carried out on the three aspects of index generation, retrieval and verification. The test results show that the scheme has high efficiency. © 2022 IEEE.},

abstract={Document Verification using Blockchain Technology has a huge scope. With increasing documents generated every year, there is no systematic and simple way to verify the documents. This system could be used to the governments, organizations, employers and basically anybody who wants to verify that the given document is not forged. This could be used to verify all kinds of immutable records ranging from attendance records, birth certificates, graduation and academic credentials. The proposed system could be used by the government to construct a decentralized network to store and maintain record. This is also the best way to ensure that the documents exist in the state of their creation, that they are not tampered with by anyone. Motivated by this, we propose to develop a decentralized blockchain system using Ethereum that will serve as an application to authenticate the documents. An application will be installed to local systems in which the users will verify the documents. These local systems also known as “Nodes” or “Blocks”.Once the documents are added to blocks forming the blockchain, complex calculations are performed to find the unique hash for that particular document.This concept can be implemented through decentralized applications deployed on the blockchain. The blockchain that is intended to be used for the deployment process is the Ropsten Ethereum Network. Thus, the immutability of documents can be maintained, while providing a simple, yet secure way for authenticating/verifying documents. © 2022 IEEE.},

abstract={In recent years, blockchain technology has been applied in the educational domain because of its salient advantages, i.e., transparency, decentralization, and immutability. Available systems typically use public blockchain networks such as Ethereum and Bitcoin to store learning results. However, the cost of writing data on these networks is significant, making educational institutions limit data sent to the target network, typically containing only hash codes of the issued certificates. In this paper, we present a system based on a private blockchain network for lifelong learning data authentication and management named B4E (Blockchain For Education). B4E stores not only certificates but also learners' training data such as transcripts and educational programs in order to create a complete record of the lifelong education of each user and verify certificates that they have obtained. As a result, B4E can address two types of fake certificates, i.e., certificates printed by unlawful organizations and certificates issued by educational institutions for learners who have not met the training requirements. In addition, B4E is designed to allow all participants to easily deploy software packages to manage, share, and check stored information without depending on a single point of access. As such, the system enhances the transparency and reliability of the stored data. Our experiments show that B4E meets expectations for deployment in reality. © 2022 CRL Publishing.

abstract={Creation and reuse of content and data are on the rise. Tracing of who, when and how has created and modified content and data in an explicit manner becomes paramount for transparent, explainable, efficient and fair digital ecosystems. We specifically address a challenge that there is currently no uniform method to link data and content with licenses explicitly, immutably and in a traceable way (with authentication). Thus we have created a blockchain-based method which makes it possible to attach semantic licenses with data and content. Ethereum and the Data Licenses and Clearance Center - “DALICC”, a software framework for automated clearance of rights, are used as a bases for our prototype implementation for the license annotation (see: https://github.com/kilianhnt/dalicc-license-annotator ). Particular care is taken to ensure that the solution remains generic. Its practical feasibility, such as compliance with requirements, particularly, authentication, affordable deployment and usage costs, is positively evaluated. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={This chapter presents a distributed e-voting system that solves the problems of vote-rigging, voter impersonation, and vote falsification, all of which are prevalent in traditional paper ballot systems. In general, the digitization of democratic decision-making is convenient, fast, and cost-saving but can become a gateway for electoral fraud if not properly secured. Authentication and the simultaneous achievement of confidentiality, integrity, and availability represent major challenges toward establishing e-voting as a reliable means of democratic decision-making. In this chapter, a combination of multifactor authentication (MFA) and blockchain techniques is used to secure electronic voting. MFA hampers the compromising of voters’ identities and allows for easy verification, while blockchain technology protects the integrity of the votes and ensures the verifiability of the cast votes. Combining a facial recognition algorithm and RFID authenticates and authorizes voters to participate in the election process. A smart contract implemented on an Ethereum network provides the required measures of integrity and verifiability for secure e-voting. Performance evaluations of the proposed approach show that the MFA yielded a 0.1% false acceptance rate and a 0.8% false rejection rate for 100 voters, respectively. This illustrates that the proposed technique can solve issues of authentication and integrity, thereby paving the way for free, fair, and credible e-democratic decision-making in digitally enabled voting scenarios. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={The existing vehicle insurance system faces number of challenges like frauds, absence of P2P insurance, no timely settlement of claims and absence of on-demand insurance. However, the existing vehicle insurance system is centralized, and not settlement of claims efficiently. Hence, to dissolve this issue, this paper presents a distributed vehicle insurance system. Blockchain is an open, public, cryptographically hashed system that gives immutability and authenticity through digital signature incorporated with hash value. Blockchain exploits hash functions and encryption in the direction of accumulation of incontrovertible records which are more strongly secure over various present very similar cybersecurity resolutions technologies. On the other hand, the existing security deals with a single trusted authority to authenticate information or accumulate encrypted data. In this paper, we proposed a decentralized application (DApp), which deliberates the introduction of blockchain technology followed by Ethereum and smart contracts. Hence, for implementing the smart contract, public blockchain platform used. Finally, the React is used for frontend development. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Patent authentication and management is a vital activity for protecting individuals' and organizations' intellectual property rights around the world. As patents are territorial and data management for patent applications is primarily handled by local intellectual property offices, the patent authentication and management procedure are inefficient and time-consuming on a worldwide scale. Furthermore, data management concerns in the patent process frequently result in conflicts and legal actions among competing parties. Blockchain technology is generally recognized for its potential application in the development of decentralized, secured, and transparent systems with immutable records. As a result, it appears to be a viable solution for overcoming issues in the patent domain. The purpose of this research is to demonstrate how blockchain technology may help with patent authentication and management. To explore the process of the existing system and its shortcomings, interviews with relevant stakeholders and a comprehensive literature review are conducted. To overcome the highlighted barriers and limitations, a novel architecture and prototype of a consortium blockchain system are proposed, with regulated bodies as nodes such as the World Intellectual Property Office and Regional IP Offices handling the consensus mechanism. The proposed consortium blockchain design is based on the Ethereum architecture and is equipped with smart contracts. To arrive at conclusions, it is tested in a simulated environment with generated actors and data. The present study demonstrates that blockchain can ensure the reliability of patent data and real-time updating of records efficiently and at a low cost. Furthermore, patents that have been registered to this network become reliable across IP offices. Without relying on a single patent office, patent applications can be approved or rejected with the proposed architecture. The prototype model shows considerable improvement in establishing evidence of first ownership which helps minimize a significant number of litigations. The study further shows how Blockchain Serves as a distributed database which is very much useful in cross-validated reliable systems like secure document management for government processes. © 2022 IEEE.},

abstract={With the rise of social network service (SNS) in recent years, the security of SNS users’ private information has been a concern for the public. However, due to the anonymity of SNS, identity impersonation is hard to be detected and prevented since users are free to create an account with any name they want. Until now, there are few studies about this problem, and none of them can perfectly handle this problem. In this paper, based on an idea from previous work, we combine blockchain technology and security protocol to prevent impersonation in SNS. In our scheme, the defects of complex and duplicated operations in the previous work are improved. And the authentication work of SNS server is also adjusted in order to resist single-point attack. Moreover, the smart contract is introduced to help the whole system runs automatically. Afterward, our proposed scheme is implemented and tested on an Ethereum test network and the result suggests that it is acceptable and suitable for nowadays SNS network. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Satoshi Nakamoto created the first decentralizedblock chain in 2008. Block chain is a relatively new and widely accepted kind of decentralized, distributed computing. The advantages of block chain technology are improved security and privacy, decreased expenses, enhanced speed, and consistency. Block chain has applications in a variety of areas, including IT, healthcare, finance, and educational institutions. For data storage, many organizations now adopt centralised cloud systems. Educational Institutes stored and shared their digitally stored data with other institutes or Vendors for various purposes like issuing certificate, so protecting the privacy while sharing the data is a problem of researchers. People create a large number of files every day and wish to save them somewhere. However, they usually rely on unsecure centralized systems. Block chain is a decentralized system that keeps files and data safe. The suggested model will eliminate all cloud storage limits. It uses a block chain and an interplanetary file system to operate. It divides educational data files into blocks and then encrypts each block with hash keysOur goal is to come up with a privacy-preserving method for sharing data via block chain. A model along with Blockchain principles and features to serve the requester and data owner authentication has been developed in a two-way system © 2022 IEEE.},

abstract={Verifiably encrypted signature (VES) allows a signer to encrypt a signature under the public key of a trusted third party (aka adjudicator) in a verifiable manner. Recently, Yang et al. proposed a practical verifiably encrypted signature scheme for ECDSA and initiated the study of escrow protocol for Bitcoin via VES. This paper generalizes and improves the VES scheme of Yang et al., such that it covers a family of signatures with similar structures, including ECDSA, Schnorr and their variants. Our construction is very efficient: comparing with Yang et al. 's construction, the size of the resulting VES (for ECDSA) is reduced by more than 25 times. The only caveat is that the adjudicator is required to store a look-up table of size around 270MB. Our scheme naturally gives rise to escrow protocols for mainstream cryptocurrencies that employ ECDSA-like signatures to authorise transaction, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Cardano, Chainlink, etc. © 2005-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={The process of certificate and credential verification of every candidate is an essential step in the recruitment phase of every organization. Today, most of this work is usually outsourced to external agencies. Owing to the presence of third parties and lack of transparency in the verification process, there is a possibility of fraud or undetected error creeping in at every stage. The recruiter is at the risk of hiring a fraudulent candidate and the candidate at the risk of facing a rejection due to inefficient verification. Moreover, the existing procedure for this verification takes around 30 days per candidate. Today, blockchain technology assisted with smart contracts have applications ranging from Supply Chain Management to Digital identity, Banking, Insurance and many (any) other scenarios where multiple entities form a network to trade or query any kind of assets. Using smart contracts, a decentralized data store, content-hash based verification and blockchain, we’ve developed a design for decentralized applications to address the existing issue of certificate and credential verification. These decentralized applications bring about transparency, privacy, provenance tracking and trust to the procedure of sharing and authenticating credentials and certificates. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed design based on the results from our implementation on Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric. In terms of efficiency, our implementations support near real-time verification of certificates and credentials, thereby providing a faster, secure and transparent verification mechanism. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) are with great potentials to facilitate traffic management and improve driver safety. Blockchain-based conditional privacy-preserving authentication (BCPPA) is proposed to achieve an optimal tradeoff among anonymity, traceability and key/certificate management in VANETs. Existing BCPPA protocols mitigate these security and privacy challenges by adding a significant cost on verification and traceability. As a result, current solutions fail to meet high mobility, low latency, and real-time requirements of VANETs. In this paper, we design three new system building blocks namely key derivation (KeyDer), signatures of knowledge (SoK) and smart contract, following by a more efficient BCPPA protocol (named as EBCPA). To show the advantage of EBCPA, we first demonstrate it can satisfy the necessary requirements (e.g. message authentication, conditional privacy protection, resilience to common attacks, and so forth). Moreover, we implement the EBCPA in the on-line Ethereum test network (Rinkeby), Hyperledger test network and VANETs simulation environment (via VanetMobiSim and NS-2). Finally, we evaluate its communication overhead and computational cost via comparing to existing BCPPA protocols that strive to achieve similar properties. From the implementation and comparison results, our proposal can improve efficiency by reducing the time cost of traceability at least 48.95% and verification at least 42.21%. IEEE},

abstract={After the distribution of the white paper on Bitcoin, published by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008, blockchain (BC) has become one of the most much of time-examined techniques for making sure about information stockpiling and moves through decentralized, trustless, shared frameworks. Blockchain Technology got its limelight after the success of a cryptocurrency named Bitcoin. Blockchain technology is completely behind working of Bitcoin. Blockchain is a tamper-proof technology with applications in a widespread area. The key behind BC is its tamper-proof nature, which provides integrity to data authentication. This paper focuses on the fundamentals of blockchain, along with its role in various other applications and technologies. The paper will also enlighten the readers about issues related to blockchain technology in integration with other technologies. The paper will expose the impact of blockchain technology in providing solutions to issues concerned with advanced technologies. This examination identifies peer-checked on writing that tries to use blockchain for cybersecurity purposes and presents a methodical investigation of the most ever now and again embraced blockchain security applications. The Internet of Things (IoT) credits itself well to novel blockchain applications, as do frameworks and machine recognition, open key cryptography, web applications, certification plans, and the ensured amassing of Personally Identifiable Information (PII). This helpful systematic review moreover uncovers understanding into the future heading of assessment, preparing, and rehearses in the blockchain and cybersecurity space, for instance, the security of blockchain in IoT, the security of blockchain for AI data, and sidechain security. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Sharing of identity information is common and is used to avail different kinds of benefits from the organisations. But this process is becoming trustless and complicated because of the involvement of physical documents or sharing through third-party online service providers. To overcome this, the paper proposes a decentralised way of sharing users’ identity information with organisations by using blockchain technology. The information stored in blockchain becomes tamper-less and credible. The identity information of the user is tagged with their public key. So, whenever the user wishes to share identity information, they simply share their public key to the organisation and provide access to them. Also, by making use of smart contracts only required information is shared with the organisation for a limited period. This avoids the leakage of identity information.

abstract={Generally, image protection is often accomplished by digital watermark, which is also widely used in the field of data protection and data ownership authentication. However, the existing digital watermark has inherent disadvantages, it needs completely trusted third parties to act as the arbitration parties, which may be difficult to achieve. Second, an image watermark algorithm will inevitably lead to the loss of image data when operating on the image data, while it is usually irreversible. The zero-watermark algorithm can solve the problem of data loss but relies more on the trusted third party than a traditional digital watermark, which makes its prospects limited. With the development of blockchain technology in recent years, its features of de-trusted third parties combine the fairness and process automation of smart contracts to make up for the shortcomings of the zero-watermarking algorithm. This paper studies image storage and authentication frameworks. This framework utilizes the advantages of zero-watermarking algorithm and blockchain, using the Inter-Planetary File System to solve the data expansion problem of blockchain, which well avoids the shortcomings of zero-watermarking algorithm and blockchain. Experiment and inference illustrate that the proposed framework is feasible. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={One of the major concerns around the globe is access to justice and with the advancement of technology, there is tremendous scope to make these judicial systems much more efficient and swift. There have been various cases in which a courthouse reopened a case after several years, and it was found that some evidence was either missing or had been tampered with. This is a big issue in countries like India where there is very minimal digitization of such documents, and it has been a great obstruction in strengthening our judicial systems. We thereby propose a system where court proceedings and case-related documents can be stored digitally on a decentralized storage with every record stored on the Ethereum blockchain. Moreover, using blockchain in the legal system will serve as a completely tamperproof solution with easy accessibility and storage for all its users. The evidence files will be stored encrypted in the decentralized storage, so even if the storage is compromised an attacker can never know the content. The private key of the case is also encrypted with an authorized user's public key and stored on the smart contract, so an authenticated user can view the case files. Hence, the objective of this paper is to propose a tamperproof solution for the digitization of court proceedings in a secure storage leveraged by blockchain technology and to also provide accessibility in a secure manner. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Open banking allows banks and financial sectors to easily access the customers' financial data which is revolutionizing. It also provides the customers with excellent cloud access to various providers' wide range of financial services. The storage of such sensitive services and data on cloud servers is a double-edged sword. It can ease and support fine-grained access to such services/data anywhere and anytime, supporting the open banking system. But, on the other hand, data privacy and secrecy are a challenge. Thus, efficient access control should exist for open banking's services and data to protect cloud-hosted financial sensitive data from unauthorized customers. This paper proposes a new access control scheme that employs blockchain for the key-revocation process. We implement the smart contract's functions on the Ethereum platform and test the contract's code on the Kovan Testnet before deploying it to the Mainnet. Although the customer is authenticated to open banking, his key/s can be revoked according to the status response of the bank branch. Thus, his access to financial services and data is denied. We did comprehensive experiments for the revocation status response time, data exchanged until receiving the revocation status, and the time spent updating the policy. Also, we compared the results of our proposed scheme with two well-known methods - Certificate Revocation List (CRL) and Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP). The experimental results show that our proposed scheme (BKR-AC) has a faster response time than Certificate Revocation List (CRL) and Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) in case of nonrevoked keys/certificates and a slower response time in case of revoked keys to avoid nonrevoking a revoked key. But the data exchanged is an average for BKR-AC between CRL and OCSP, which is still a tiny amount and accepted. The security analysis proved that our scheme is secure against some well-known attacks on open banking systems. In addition, it is also secured against the chosen-text attack by employing the challenge-response authentication mechanism. © 2022 Khaled Riad and Mohamed Elhoseny.},

abstract={Users in blockchain systems are exposed to address replacement attacks due to the weak binding between websites and smart contracts, as they have no way to verify the authenticity of obtained addresses. Prior research introduced TLS-endorsed Smart Contracts (TeSC) that equip Smart Contracts with authentication information, proving the relation to the domain name of the respective website. For an efficient and user-friendly approach, this technology needs to be integrated with wallets. Based on the analysis of browser warnings regarding TLS-certificates, we augment MetaMask with the ability to detect TeSC and warn users if attack scenarios are detected. To evaluate our work, we conduct a study with 40 participants to show the effectiveness of TeSC to prevent address-replacement attacks and ensure the safe interaction of users and addresses. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Credentials are one of the most important things to prove oneself in modern society. As the world goes digital, credentials change its form from paper to digital. However, digital data are easy to be forged and to be duplicated. To make digital data secure, cryptographic digital signature is the key technology ensuring its authenticity and integrity. And it is an inevitable choice for secure credential management systems. Recently blockchain has been raised as another key technology to guarantee data transparency. It is a decentralized and public ledger of transactions that anyone can participate and execute programs called smart contract. In this paper, we propose a credential management system based on Ethereum blockchain. This system provides users with a means both to manage their credentials by themselves and to prove their credentials without the issuer. We implemented its prototype on Ethereum, and analyzed the proposed system compared to previous systems. © 2022 Korean Institute of Electrical Engineers. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Explainable recommendations enable users to understand why certain items are suggested and, ultimately, nurture system transparency, trustworthiness, and confidence. Large crowdsourcing recommendation systems ought to crucially promote authenticity and transparency of recommendations. To address such challenge, this paper proposes the use of stream-based explainable recommendations via blockchain profiling. Our contribution relies on chained historical data to improve the quality and transparency of online collaborative recommendation filters - Memory-based and Model-based - using, as use cases, data streamed from two large tourism crowdsourcing platforms, namely Expedia and TripAdvisor. Building historical trust-based models of raters, our method is implemented as an external module and integrated with the collaborative filter through a post-recommendation component. The inter-user trust profiling history, traceability and authenticity are ensured by blockchain, since these profiles are stored as a smart contract in a private Ethereum network. Our empirical evaluation with HotelExpedia and Tripadvisor has consistently shown the positive impact of blockchain-based profiling on the quality (measured as recall) and transparency (determined via explanations) of recommendations. © 2022 - IOS Press.

funding_text 1={Crowdsourcing platforms rely on voluntary contributions, such as ratings, reviews or views, to gener- ate recommendations. While research has shown that richer profiles improve the accuracy of the recommendations, these recommendations are mostly opaque to the end-user. To address this problem, this work explores the generation of trustworthy explanations supported by blockchain technology. Our proposal explores: (i) incremental trust and reputation profiling with look-back refinement; (ii) the storage of inter-user trust in a blockchain smart contract; and (iii) post-filtering as a means to improve and explain collaborative recommendations.},

abstract={The electronic health record (EHR) system is a cloud-based patient health record in digital format that often includes contact information about the patient, test reports, medical history, and current and previous prescriptions. However, data breaches in cloud-based EHRs pose significant privacy and security concerns for a variety of health care organizations. Cryptographic techniques currently in use are inadequate to secure EHR data in the cloud from data breaches. Blockchain technology is a new technology that can be used to address security and privacy problems with EHR data on the blockchain in a decentralized manner. We have created a stable decentralized medical blockchain in this paper to address privacy and security concerns when sharing patient data on health care between medical organizations. The health care data is encrypted using Advanced Encryption Standard-based lightweight authenticated encryption algorithm before being uploaded to a cloud-based blockchain and Solidity smart code built on Ethereum to restrict access to EHR data in the cloud. We have used an InterPlanetary file system to store data because it is distributed and ensures record immutability. The medical blockchain also ensures that patient EHR data is interoperable, traceable, and anonymous across organizations. The stable cloud-based blockchain of medical records visualizes patient care data in a distributed and immutable environment with enhanced protection. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={The IoT and blockchain were the biggest technology that was growing in day to day life. The testing as well as validating is the one that deals with all the errors. The testing and validating are heterogeneous, and it has its own challenges. The emphasis on formal confirmation procedures has implied that less consideration has been given toward testing systems. The scope of this work relies on security testing for blockchain-enabled IoT system. The blockchain is used to store the database and provides security from unauthorized user. Right now, we talk about plan, testing strategies, furthermore, instruments to permit security testing at scale of blockchain and IoT applications. A framework influences Ethereum for authentication, reputation, identity of IoT gadgets. Gadgets are enlisted in a keen agreement by means of a web interface and send cryptographically marked messages to a stage that validates them by blockchain. Then by using security testing, it determines the data and the resources are protected and also it will be preserved from vulnerabilities and checks if it provides better platform for authorized users. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Humans used machines that run manually to meet their needs. Nowadays, humans can interact with smart machines that perform tasks both manually and automatically, including work-related tasks. The growth of smart machines is increasing rapidly over a short period of time. Smart machines can work under certain protocols. The fundamental concept of smart machines is that they perform activities allocated to them. There are two types of smart machines: wired machines and wireless machines. Wired machines run their best; on the other hand, there are some issues with wireless machines. They failed to develop a permanent and private network, as well as provide data protection. Researchers consider this as a serious issue, so they partnered up with the industry sector and created an application to solve this issue. The application solution is “blockchain.” Blockchain is a process of actually collecting and growing the record list that gets interconnected with the help of certain protocols of cryptography. Every block contains a hash that is generated by associating with the previous block using transition data with a timestamp. Blockchain provides the public, private, consortium, and hybrid blockchains a wide range of built-in features. The scope of the industry sector is that the application can be used for a variety of purposes, such as security, transactions, and capability. And also this sector can also lead to practical applications such as healthcare management system. Blockchain applications in the healthcare management system require record sharing with efficient data interoperability and authentication. After building this application, we can use it for fraud detection, verification, and identification among others. Before, all systems built in the healthcare system were well-organized, but the problem was a lack of stringent authentication. The existing systems also focus on the healthcare system, but the problem is that there is no security for patient data as confidential medical records are moved from one hospital to another for specialized treatments. In this proposed system, we can build this application using blockchain with stringent authentication. By considering this problem, we can propose the ADS application. SADS stands for stringent authentication and decentralized storage using blockchain. Stringent authentication is the process of providing high security protocols to the network using cryptographic SHA-256 hash algorithm. This application can be implemented using Ethereum blockchain technology. Decentralized storage is utilized for blockchain. Decentralized storage is where breaking up of storage records takes place from one major server to multiple servers. This allows easy access to medical information and also helps to further research. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Modern healthcare systems are extremely complicated and expensive. This can be minimized through better monitoring of health records, using Blockchain technology. The first implementation of Blockchain was done to provide distributed records of money-related transactions which were not reliant on unified authorities or financial institutions and seem to provide the way for trend in the traditional healthcare industry benefitting by its unique features such as data isolation and transparency. The system proposes a Sidechain-Blockchain Technology to store and manage patient data and authentication of the same. In addition to that, the main blockchain can transmit or share the patient information record with other smart systems. The system is implemented using optimized Interplanetary File System in order to provide faster and safe access of information between the main Blockchain and side blockchain using Ethereum Dapp. The proposed model uses different development environments to build a highly effective EHR that is not controlled by a single point of authority and uses a decentralized system for storage. It’s worth noting that the implementation of Blockchain-sidechain on top of ethereum results in patient-centered access to the data and improves scalability. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={This work presents how a digital identity management system can support food supply chains in guaranteeing the quality of the products marketed and the compliance of the several supplychain’s nodes to standards and technical regulations. Specific goal of this work is to present a system that provides full visibility of process/food certifications, which nowadays are issued by accredited and approved certification bodies (issuers) and delivered and stored in paper version by the several participants (holders) of the supply chain. The system is designed and implemented by combining the latest most innovative and disruptive technologies in the market—Self Sovereign Identity system, Blockchain, and Inter Planetary File System. The crucial aspects that it aims to hit are the storage and access of food/process certifications, and the proper eligibility verification of these certifications exploiting the concepts of the Self Sovereign Identity-based models. The proposed system, realized by using standards that are WWW Consortium-compatible and the Ethereum Blockchain, ensures eligibility, transparency, and traceability of the certifications along a food supply chain, and could be an innovation model/idea that the companies that adopt the Open Innovation paradigm might want to pursue. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={While Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) can potentially improve driver safety and traffic mangement efficiency (e.g. through timely sharing of traffic status among vehicles), security and privacy are two ongoing issues that need to be addressed. Hence, security solutions such as conditional privacy-preserving authentication (CPPA) protocols have been proposed. However, CPPA protocols are generally far from being ready for deployment in VANETs, for example due key/certificate management limitations in PKI-based protocols or intractable private key updating in ID-based protocols. Although serveral blockchain-based CPPA (BCPPA) protocols have been proposed to mitigiate these challenges, there still exist some intractabilities such as revoking private key, or frequent interactions, or requiring an idea hardware. Thus, in this paper, we are motivated to propose a novel BCPPA protocol without these existing issues. Specifically, we present a PKI-based solution (using a typical digital signature protocol, such as ECDSA) based on Ethereum (a public blockchain), which is designed to facilitate secure communication in VANETs. In other words, we combine the blockchain technology and a key derivation algorithm to realize an effective certificate management. This reduces the need for participating vehicles to store a large number of private keys. To reduce the verification time cost, our BCPPA suppotrs replacing ECDSA with modified ECDSA for batch verification or directly adopting other PKI-based signatures with batch verification. In addition to introducing the concrete design, we also present the security requirements that our BCPPA protocol can satisfy. We then implement BCPPA in the Ethereum test network (i.e. Rinkeby) and provide simulations using VanetMobiSim and NS-2 to show its feasibility (i.e. milliseconds). © 2000-2011 IEEE.},

abstract={In large organizations, we achieve security by limiting unnecessary access to shared resources based on the users' roles. It reduces administrative work and enhances security. Due to the security requirements of role-centric authentication and access management, it is challenging to create an efficient centralized system for distributed applications. Centralized authentication and access control systems are prone to single-point failure, security threats, privacy, and scalability issues. This paper presents a decentralized role-centric authentication and resource access management technique called RC-AAM. It relies on the security features provided by cryptography and blockchain, and provides role ownership proof, role verification, and role validation without depending on a central authority. RC-AAM prototype is deployed and tested on the Ethereum test network. The results show that the proposed technique is efficient in terms of access management, permissions verification, incurs low cost, and is able to satisfy distributed environment requirements. Moreover, it shows superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art techniques of role-centric authentication and access management. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) applications have gained a huge momentum and have spanned across all domains adding innovations to the prevailing solutions. The IoT networks generate enormous data comprising meteorological information, patient critical body parameters, finance, logistics, location of a tracking object, etc. Security for sensitive data,such as patient body critical parameters from an attached monitoring device, streaming over IoT networks is vital and is a need of the hour. Data integrity and user (or device) authentication are crucial for building a trust-worthy communication network among the peers in IoT networks. Most networks still employ specific software encryption algorithms that provide considerable data security. But quantum computing has proved the vulnerability of computationally vigorous cryptographic algorithms. A decentralized and scalable framework for device authentication and data security is proposed in this paper based on blockchain platform and Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs). An authentication protocol is developed using PUF-based cryptographic primitives. The PUF-based keys are hard to replicate and almost impossible to predict because of the randomness in the physical design and complex mathematical modeling of the system. Lightweight Smart contracts are used to facilitate role-based access control. Data privacy is preserved by storing the sensitive data off-chain. As a proof of concept, an IoT-based healthcare system based on Ethereum permissioned blockchain is developed using the proposed framework. The​ designed PUF exhibits 48.46% uniqueness and 2.38% reliability. A comparative analysis with existing similar models shows that the proposed approach is feasible and provides a scalable solution for device authentication and data security in resource-limited medical IoT networks. © 2021},

abstract={With the proliferation of intelligent devices in the Internet of Things (IoT), the security of IoT devices is becoming a major concern as an attacker can exploit network services via network capture or deployment of malicious devices. Therefore, IoT device authentication is a key security requirement. Conventional authentication approaches have proved insufficient in dealing with a large number of IoT devices because of various shortcomings, such as centrally designed architectures and expensive cryptographic primitives. Blockchain technology has led to the creation of decentralised IoT authentication solutions with their desirable characteristics. Due to the integration of IoT and Blockchain technology, however, performance is one of the significant challenges. Existing Blockchain-based authentication schemes create extra storage, computing and communication overheads on the Blockchain which restricts its use for different IoT networks. In this paper, we design an efficient decentralised Blockchain-based authentication scheme aimed at achieving a secure authentication for IoT devices using the token mechanism. We design the Ethereum Blockchain network model to implement our scheme, in which smart contracts provide secure connectivity between miner nodes and IoT devices. We demonstrate our proposed scheme with an IoT-based smart home case study, which shows significant performance in computation and communication overheads compared with existing Blockchain-based authentication schemes. The modelling, analysis and verification of the proposed scheme, using high level Petri nets (HLPNs) and Z3 SMT solver are also provided to prove correctness and to verify the claims of our model. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Safely keeping the account's private key is vital in blockchain technology, as there are no native blockchain mechanisms for recovering the account when the private key is lost. Therefore, this paper proposes a solution to this problem, running directly on the blockchain platform in the form of a smart contract, enabling deposit of digital assets into the contract for safekeeping, along with a list of security questions. The proposed solution can be used, for example, in online games. By providing proof of knowing answers to questions, a player can access his account without his private key. Furthermore, additional security measures are put in place to cope with malicious behaviour. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={When software systems become more complex, it can be advantageous to partition their code into multiple, separate components. In this work, we examine how multiple smart contracts can be coupled to work together. When coupling smart contracts, different design approaches are possible with their own advantages and disadvantages. As an example, we couple two smart contract applications on the Ethereum blockchain: Palinodia and DecentID. Palinodia can be used to ensure the integrity of downloaded executable binaries by checking their hashes against the hashes stored in the blockchain. To make sure that not everyone can modify the data stored on the blockchain, an identity management system is required. This task is fulfilled by DecentID, which provides decentralized identities stored as smart contracts on the blockchain. We evaluate approaches of coupling these two applications and discuss their benefits and drawbacks for this use case. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={Under the ravages of the COVID-19, online education platform business has achieved rapid development, and excessive platform integration and the spread of paid knowledge have also spawned security problems of data sharing between platforms and users. Meanwhile, the development of Internet technology has also increased the difficulty of knowledge safeguarding rights on education platforms and cracking down on piracy. Based on the application characteristics of blockchain technology, this paper proposes a dual authentication mode of node + platform based on hash detection. Through the smart contract provided by Ethereum, data encryption linking and two-way verification between different platforms are realized. After linking to blockchain, data transmitted over the network can be protected from hacking and tampering. The research in this paper has an enlightening effect on promoting the integration development of blockchain technology and emerging industries, and also makes a specific judgment on the next integration development direction. © 2021 ACM.},

abstract={Blockchain-based cryptocurrencies offer an appealing alternative to Fiat currencies, due to their decentralized and borderless nature. However the decentralized settings make the authentication process more challenging: Standard cryptographic methods often rely on the ability of users to reliably store a (large) secret information. What happens if one user's key is lost or stolen? Blockchain systems lack of fallback mechanisms that allow one to recover from such an event, whereas the traditional banking system has developed and deploys quite effective solutions. In this work, we develop new cryptographic techniques to integrate security policies (developed in the traditional banking domain) in the blockchain settings. We propose a system where a smart contract is given the custody of the user's funds and has the ability to invoke a two-factor authentication (2FA) procedure in case of an exceptional event (e.g., a particularly large transaction or a key recovery request). To enable this, the owner of the account secret-shares the answers of some security questions among a committee of users. When the 2FA mechanism is triggered, the committee members can provide the smart contract with enough information to check whether an attempt was successful, and nothing more. We then design a protocol that securely and efficiently implements such a functionality: The protocol is round-optimal, is robust to the corruption of a subset of committee members, supports low-entropy secrets, and is concretely efficient. As a stepping stone towards the design of this protocol, we introduce a new threshold homomorphic encryption scheme for linear predicates from bilinear maps, which might be of independent interest. To substantiate the practicality of our approach, we implement the above protocol as a smart contract in Ethereum and show that it can be used today as an additional safeguard for suspicious transactions, at minimal added cost. We also implement a second scheme where the smart contract additionally requests a signature from a physical hardware token, whose verification key is registered upfront by the owner of the funds. We show how to integrate the widely used universal two-factor authentication (U2F) tokens in blockchain environments, thus enabling the deployment of our system with available hardware. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is the fundamental of secure digital communications. It provides a secure means to authenticate identities over the Internet. Symmetric or asymmetric encryption schemes are widely used in identity authentication in any kind of PKI. The conventional PKI has several drawbacks due to the centralized and non-transparent design. Several recent research works utilize blockchain technology to overcome the limitations of conventional implementations of PKI. Blockchain-based PKI integrates blockchain technology with PKI to form a new type of decentralized PKI (DPKI). Several works utilize the currency property in blockchains to implement the reward-and-punishment mechanism. In this paper, we propose a smart contract-based PKI which utilizes the Ethereum smart contract to build a new type of blockchain-based PKI with the reward-and-punishment mechanism using ERC-20 tokens. It has several advantages over previous implementations of similar research that use Ethereum’s main currency—Ether. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Since the last few decades, information security has become a significant challenge for organizations’ system administrators. However, the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model has emerged as a viable solution for organizations to meet the security requirement due to its less administrative overhead. Blockchain technology is distributive and can be used effectively in user authentication and authorization challenges. This paper proposes an RBAC model using a blockchain-based smart contract for managing user-role permissions in the organization. We design a threat and security model to resist attacks such as man-in-the-middle attacks in an organization scenario. The proposed approach uses the Ethereum blockchain platform and its smart contract functionalities to model user-resource communications. The proposed method is tested on Ropsten Ethereum Test Network and evaluated to analyze user authentication, verification, cost, and security. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Recent years have seen an increase in medical big data, which can be attributed to a paradigm shift experienced in medical data sharing induced by the growth of medical technology and the Internet of Things. The evidence of this potential has been proved during the recent covid-19 pandemic, which was characterised by the use of medical wearable devices to help with the medical data exchange between the healthcare providers and patients in a bid to contain the pandemic. However, the use of these technologies has also raised questions and concerns about security and privacy risks. To assist in resolving this issue, this paper proposes a blockchain-based access control framework for managing access to users' medical data. This is facilitated by using a smart contract on the blockchain, which allows for delegated access control and secure user authentication. This solution leverages blockchain technology's inherent autonomy and immutability to solve the existing access control challenges. We have presented the solution in the form of a medical wearable sensor prototype and a mobile app that uses the Ethereum blockchain in a real data sharing control scenario. Based on the empirical results, the proposed solution has proven effective. It has the potential to facilitate reliable data exchange while also protecting sensitive health information against potential threats. When subjected to security analysis and evaluation, the system exhibits performance improvements in data privacy levels, high security and lightweight access control design compared to the current centralised access control models. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={Maintaining a balance between anonymity and traceability is a fundamental issue in privacy-preserving systems. Isshiki et al. proposed an identity management system based on group signatures in which a service provider anonymously determines whether or not users of the service are legitimate members, and only a bill collector can identify users for the purposes of sending them invoices. It is particularly worth noting that, under the Isshiki system, the service provider is not required to manage personal information such as user lists, which allows the system to outperform other in terms of preserving user privacy and managing personal information leakage risk. It is also noteworthy that the Isshiki system only considers cases in which the bill collector identifies users who have used the service and that, in fact, identified users who ignore invoices can use the service for free. In this paper, we extended the Isshiki system by adding a smart contract-enabled enforcement bill collection functionality. Under this functionality, deposits made by users who do not pay a service fee are automatically transferred to the bill collector. Because of their centralized structure, group signatures are not suitable to blockchain systems, therefore, the proposed system employs accountable ring signatures as building blocks. The privacy-preserving enforced bill collection system is implemented using the accountable ring signature scheme developed by Bootle et al. and Ethereum smart contracts. To reduce the gas costs associated with running smart contracts, the smart contract is not run unless the user ignores an invoice, and basic procedures are run via an off-chain channel. To avoid the use of heavy cryptographic algorithms in carrying out the accountable ring signature scheme for running smart contracts, we employed standard elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA) signatures without especially changing the state to be verified in smart contracts. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={The study presents a blockchain-based incentive mechanism intended to encourage those in underserved communities to engage with healthcare services. The smart healthcare system, which is the result of the amalgamation of advanced technologies, has emerged recently and is increasingly seen as essential to meet the needs of modern society. An important part of the healthcare system is the prescription management system, but studies show that prescription affordability and accessibility play a part in creating unequal access for underserved communities. This is a form of unequal access that results in those living in underserved communities to become disengaged from accessing healthcare services. In New Zealand, the prescription management system plays a crucial role and this study seeks to address the issue by presenting the BlockPres framework, which uses a novel incentive mechanism to encourage patients to participate and engage with services in order to be rewarded. The blockchain attribute of immutability in BlockPres enhances equality and participation by providing sophisticated authorisation and authentication capabilities for healthcare providers and patients. BlockPres empowers the patient by assigning ownership or control of some patient information to the patient. A simulation is carried out using the Ethereum blockchain and the evaluation of successful transaction completion and superficial performance assessment demonstrates that the blockchain would be sufficient to cope with the needs of a prescription management system. Furthermore, for the simulation, a BlockPres Smart Contract is developed using solidity and implemented in Remix. The Ropsten network is used as the simulation environment and the initial results show that the proposed incentive mechanism mitigates unequal access. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={The ever-growing trend of making the traditional power grids smarter than before has resulted in their gradual evolution to more sophisticated grids, referred to as Smart Grids (SGs) Cyber-Physical Systems with complex networking technologies. The integration of Information and Communication Technologies with power grids fosters seamless data sharing between different SG entities, which supports effective and smart governance in terms of demand response management, frequency support, and voltage stabilization. Nonetheless, this integration opens up several security and privacy concerns, namely, electricity theft, power loss, battery exhaustion, infrastructure mapping, etc. These issues become even more important with the addition of distributed energy sources, e.g. electric vehicles (EVs), battery energy storage systems, and renewable energy sources, into the SGs. We present a framework based on Software Defined Networking (SDN) and BlockChain (BC) to address two challenging issues of EV-aided SG ecosystems, namely, privacy assurance and power security. We leverage the capabilities of SDN to handle the complex interactions between different subsystems of the SG. Furthermore, we also employ BC and smart contracts' properties to secure energy transactions and data communications. We design a secure and efficient mutual authentication protocol based on Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) and BC for privacy preservation during smart energy trading. We also proposed a BC-based smart contract for effective Demand Response Management (DRM) during bidirectional energy transfer between EVs and SG. Finally, we present experimental evaluations to validate the proposed framework's performance. The results obtained demonstrate the improved performance of the proposed scheme compared with current state-of-the-art approaches. The mutual authentication protocol designed is not only secure against major attack vectors (namely, session key security, message integrity, anonymity, forward secrecy, and so on), but it is also cost-efficient in terms of communication and computational costs. Additionally, the SC designed assures power security and maintains an adequate balance between demand and supply. © 2000-2011 IEEE.},

abstract={A Large-Scale Heterogeneous Network (LS-HetNet) integrates different networks into one uniform network system to provide seamless one-world network coverage. In LS-HetNet, various devices use different technologies to access heterogeneous networks and generate a large amount of data. For dealing with a large number of access requirements, these data are usually stored in the HetNet Domain Management Server (HDMS) of the current domain, and HDMS uses a centralized Authentication/Authorization/Auditing (AAA) scheme to protect the data. However, this centralized method easily causes the data to be modified or disclosed. To address this issue, we propose a blockchain-empowered AAA scheme for accessing data of LS-HetNet. Firstly, the account address of the blockchain is used as the identity authentication, and the access control permission of data is redesigned and stored on the blockchain, then processes of AAA are redefined. Finally, the experimental model on Ethereum private chain is built, and the results show that the scheme is not only secure but also decentral, without tampering and trustworthiness. © 2020 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications},

abstract={Public key infrastructure (PKI) is widely used over the Internet to secure and to encrypt communication among parties. PKI involves digital certificates which are managed by certificate authorities (CAs) that authenticate users identity, in order to establish encrypted communication channels. The centralized operation model of CAs has already caused several targeted attacks due to the distribution of rogue certificates. Users remain vulnerable since it is too challenging to detect and revoke such certificates, but also to speed up the user update process when a certificate is revoked. To address such issues, a decentralized PKI alternative approach, targeting Domain Validated certificates, is proposed. In the proposed approach, which is based on blockchain technologies (such as Bitcoin and Ethereum), the transparency, immutability and decentralization aspects of these technologies have been leveraged. Comparisons among the proposed approach, the conventional PKI and other decentralized approaches have been implemented to showcase the impact and the potential of the proposed approach. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The security proposed for Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) systems in the European Union is specified in the ETSI Cooperative Intelligent Transport System (C-ITS) standards, and related documents are based on the trusted PKI/CAs. The C-ITS trust model platform comprises an EU Root CA and additional Root CAs run in Europe by member state authorities or private organizations offering certificates to individual users. A new method is described in this paper where the security in V2X is based on the Distributed Public Keystore (DPK) platform developed for Ethereum blockchain. The V2X security is considered as one application of the DPK platform. The DPK stores and distributes the vehicles, RSUs, or other C-ITS role-players' public keys. It establishes a generic key exchange/agreement scheme that provides mutual key, entity authentication, and distributing a session key between two peers. V2X communication based on this scheme can establish an end-to-end (e2e) secure session and enables vehicle authentication without the need for a vehicle certificate signed by a trusted Certificate Authority. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={Blockchain's decentralized characteristic is recognized as a potential technology to deliver secure and safe resources. However, the existing blockchain networks cannot fulfil the transaction given the limited bandwidth for practical application demand. In this article, the cubic design of the conventional public blockchain is strengthened with the Directed Graph Probabilistic model. In the current structure, blocks of the lightweight structure are ordered in grades and width. We develop protocols to position newly created blocks in order to make them more effective and secure. It increases confidentiality and time for authentication of transactions in contrast with standard blockchain protocols and enjoys the accuracy and liveliness of blockchain. This paper introduces two potential methods for targeting opposition parties and we also show that the procedure against them is safe and stable. Experiments will generate three hundred inputs every second that is 64 times the output of Bitcoin's transaction. This time Bitcoin's production will hit 27 times its Ethereum's. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={In distributed energy trading, a traditional centralized energy trading platform is not designed to deal with massive, frequent, and small-scale transactions. Its limitations includes high operation and maintenance cost, lack of autonomy and transparency, etc. Thus, respective scheme is needed to be explored. A distributed energy trading scheme was proposed in this paper, based on blockchain, which was in line with China's related policies regarding three parts: a listed trading mechanism that takes into account differences in network fees, a renewable energy consumption certification mechanism, and a credit management mechanism. Also, corresponding smart contact was designed and simulated in Ethereum private chain. The result shows that the scheme in the paper could increase income of all participants and improve efficiency of the regulator effectively. © 2021 Chin. Soc. for Elec. Eng.},

abstract={The rapid growth and advancement of technology in industries provide a better quality of services to the end-user in the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). The digital twin (DT) is an innovative technology recently developed in Industry 4.0 to provide a virtual representation of physical components, products, or equipment such as computer numerical control (CNC) machines. It can be used to run simulations before manufacturing. However, traditional DT platforms lack data privacy, traceability, immutability, authentication of stakeholders. Moreover, manual prediction of the wearing of the tool condition of the CNC machine is challenging. Motivated from these gaps, in this paper, we propose a six-layered architecture for DT of CNC, which predicts CNC tool wear detection using a novel ensemble technique based soft voted prediction model consisting of XGBoost, random forest, and AdaBoost models. The proposed architecture also incorporates the public Ethereum blockchain (BC) to maintain the aforementioned issues of authentication, traceability, and transparency through constraints and automation programmed into the smart contracts (SC) developed. We evaluate the proposed scheme's performance through simulation and compare it with other traditional approaches concerning several performance parameters (accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall). The result shows that the proposed approach outperforms the traditional approaches on these same performance parameters such as accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={In recent years, the number of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices has grown at an explosive rate. With the dramatic surge of the IoT, security issues have also come to the fore. Consequently, ensuring the security of the IoT communication community environment and trust between entities have become important research topics. In this paper, we design a passwordless IoT authentication mechanism, namely, T-Auth, to address these issues. The identity of a device in T-Auth is based on physical unclonable functions (PUFs), a hardware-based device fingerprint technology, which can greatly improve the security level compared to hardcoded passwords. A smart contract is a program that runs on the blockchain, which provides design flexibility and operational reliability. Our mechanism establishes a new trust architecture that enables devices to exchange information securely and reliably. The main contribution of this paper is to propose a new authentication mechanism that utilizes PUFs and combines them with blockchain to greatly improve the security and reliability of a system. Additionally, by leveraging Ethereum smart contracts, our mechanism supports cross-service group authentication. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={COVID-19 has made eHealth an imperative. The pandemic has been a true catalyst for remote eHealth solutions such as teleHealth. Telehealth facilitates care, diagnoses, and treatment remotely, making them more efficient, accessible, and economical. However, they have a centralized identity management system that restricts the interoperability of patient and healthcare provider identification. Thus, creating silos of users that are unable to authenticate themselves beyond their eHealth application’s domain. Furthermore, the consumers of remote eHealth applications are forced to trust their service providers completely. They cannot check whether their eHealth service providers adhere to the regulations to ensure the security and privacy of their identity information. Therefore, we present a blockchain-based decentralized identity management system that allows patients and healthcare providers to identify and authenticate themselves transparently and securely across different eHealth domains. Patients and healthcare providers are uniquely identified by their health identifiers (healthIDs). The identity attributes are attested by a healthcare regulator, indexed on the blockchain, and stored by the identity owner. We implemented smart contracts on an Ethereum consortium blockchain to facilities identification and authentication procedures. We further analyze the performance using different metrics, including transaction gas cost, transaction per second, number of blocks lost, and block propagation time. Parameters including block-time, gas-limit, and sealers are adjusted to achieve the optimal performance of our consortium blockchain. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={We propose a cryptographic technique for an authenticated, end-to-end verifiable and secret ballot election. Currently, almost all verifiable e-voting systems require trusted authorities to perform the tallying process except for the DRE-i and DRE-ip systems. We have shown a weakness of the DRE-ip system and proposed a solution. We propose a secure and verifiable voter registration and authentication mechanism. The proposed scheme prevents ballot stuffing attack. We have modified the DRE-ip system so that no adversary can create and post a valid ballot on the public bulletin board without detection. We propose a method for publishing the final tally without revealing the tally from individual Direct-Recording Electronic (DRE) machines using secure multi-party computation and non-interactive zero-knowledge (NIZK) proof. We propose two methods to store these ballots using blockchain and cloud server. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first end-to-end verifiable DRE based e-voting system using blockchain. We provide security proofs to prove the security properties of the proposed scheme. We prove that the efficient NIZK proof proposed by Lin et al. in APSIPA ASC 2019 is not correct since it does not satisfy the witness indistinguishability property of a zero-knowledge proof. We introduce an improved NIZK proof that boosts the efficiency of the system. The experimental data obtained from our tests show the protocol's potential for real-world deployment. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={With the advancement of blockchain technology, and the proliferation of Internet of things (IoT)-driven devices, the blockchain-IoT applications is changing the perception and working infrastructure of smart networks. Blockchain supports decentralized architecture and provides secure management, authentication, and access to IoT systems by deploying smart contracts provided by Ethereum. The growing demand and expansion of blockchain-IoT systems is generating large volume of sensitive data. Moreover, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks are the most challenging threats to smart contracts in blockchain-IoT systems. The 2016 decentralized autonomous organization and 2017 parity wallet attacks exposed the critical fault-lines among Ethereum smart contracts. Currently, there is no security mechanism available for smart contracts after its deployment in blockchain-IoT systems. In order to address these challenges, first we use two artificial intelligence techniques, random forest (RF) and XGBoost that gives full autonomy in decision making capabilities in the proposed security framework. Second, for data load balancing and distributed file storage of IoT data, interplanetary file system is suggested. Finally, we are the first to propose a distributed framework based on fog computing to detect DDoS attacks in smart contracts. The performance of the detection system is evaluated using actual IoT dataset, namely, BoT-IoT. The proposed system is evaluated in terms of accuracy (AC), detection rate (DR), and false alarm rate (FAR). The results confirms the superiority of the proposed framework over some of the recent state-of-art techniques in detecting rare attacks. The proposed framework has achieved DR up to 99.99% using RF by using 10 features of BoT-IoT dataset. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract={In cryptography, many different data structures are used to store and encrypt data. Merkle Tree is such a data structure that provides a way to prove data integrity and validity. It requires less memory or disk space than other data structures, resulting in simple and fast computation. This paper first explains the detailed principles and then introduces the application fields of Merkle Tree. Merkle Tree uses the hash value of the data block as leaf node tags and the encrypted hash of the child node tags as other node tags. As data structures evolve and innovate, Merkle Tree provides help and inspiration for the future new data structures. Furthermore, we investigate various applications using Merkle Tree technology, including Smart Grid, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Interplanetary File System, Image Authentication, Public Security Audit of Cloud Computing, SIMulator for Blockchain Applications, Hardware Memory Integrity, and Certificate Transparency. These researches show that Merkle Tree applies to a wide range of fields and has great potential. In brief, the paper aims to help researchers better understand the Merkle Tree features and various roles and effects in different environments, contributing to the development of cryptography. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={Current permissionless cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin suffer from a limited transaction rate and slow confirmation time, which hinders further adoption. Payment channels are one of the most promising solutions to address these problems, as they allow the parties of the channel to perform arbitrarily many payments in a peer-to-peer fashion while uploading only two transactions on the blockchain. This concept has been generalized into payment channel networks where a path of payment channels is used to settle the payment between two users that might not share a direct channel between them. However, this approach requires the active involvement of each user in the path, making the system less reliable (they might be offline), more expensive (they charge fees per payment), and slower (intermediaries need to be actively involved in the payment). To mitigate this issue, recent work has introduced the concept of virtual channels (IEEE SP'19), which involve intermediaries only in the initial creation of a bridge between payer and payee, who can later on independently perform arbitrarily many off-chain transactions. Unfortunately, existing constructions are only available for Ethereum, as they rely on its account model and Turing-complete scripting language. The realization of virtual channels in other blockchain technologies with limited scripting capabilities, like Bitcoin, was so far considered an open challenge.In this work, we present the first virtual channel protocols that are built on the UTXO-model and require a scripting language supporting only a digital signature scheme and a timelock functionality, being thus backward compatible with virtually every cryptocurrency, including Bitcoin. We formalize the security properties of virtual channels as an ideal functionality in the Universal Composability framework and prove that our protocol constitutes a secure realization thereof. We have prototyped and evaluated our protocol on the Bitcoin blockchain, demonstrating its efficiency: for n sequential payments, they require an off-chain exchange of 9+2n transactions or a total of 3524+695n bytes, with no on-chain footprint in the optimistic case. This is a substantial improvement compared to routing payments in a payment channel network, which requires 8n transactions with a total of 3026n bytes to be exchanged. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={The proliferation of IoT devices in society demands a renewed focus on securing the use and maintenance of such systems. IoT-based systems have a significant impact on society and therefore such systems must have guaranteed resilience. We introduce a solution as a protocol that utilizes smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain to enforce a security model that helps maintain distributed IoT networks in a healthy condition throughout their lifecycle. Our protocol enforces secured deployment, communication, management, and maintenance for hardened IoT devices. We additionally propose a smart contract solution for creating and handling generic IoT tasks. This solution enables users to manage devices by utilizing the Ethereum infrastructure for authentication, authorization, and communication. This design allows the devices to function autonomously by interpreting tasks received through smart contract transactions, without any direct human to device interaction. The result is a protocol that provides mechanisms for authentication and authorization, task provisioning, and audit trails. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are widely used in blockchain to represent unique and non-interchangeable assets. Current NFTs allow representing assets by a unique identifier, as a possession of an owner. The novelty introduced in this paper is the proposal of smart NFTs to represent IoT devices, which are physical smart assets. Hence, they are also identified as the utility of a user, they have a blockchain account (BCA) address to participate actively in the blockchain transactions, they can establish secure communication channels with owners and users, and they operate dynamically with several modes associated with their token states. A smart NFT is physically bound to its IoT device thanks to the use of a physical unclonable function (PUF) that allows recovering its private key and, then, its BCA address. The link between tokens and devices is difficult to break and can be traced during their lifetime, because devices execute a secure boot and carry out mutual authentication processes with new owners and users that could add new software. Hence, devices prove their trusted hardware and software. A whole demonstration of the proposal developed with ESP32-based IoT devices and Ethereum blockchain is presented, using the SRAM of the ESP32 microcontroller as the PUF. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={With the rise of digitization, documents are being created, modified, and shared digitally. Unlike hard copies, it is difficult to ascertain the authenticity of these digital documents. Thus, there is a need to authenticate and verify digital documents in an efficient manner. In this chapter, a decentralized application has been proposed, which uses a smart contract to facilitate the authentication and verification of documents by leveraging the blockchain technology. In contrast to the traditional way of storing the entire input digital document, this approach creates a unique fingerprint of every input document by using a cryptographic hash function. This fingerprint is stored on the blockchain network to verify the document in future. This blockchain based solution can be used by organizations to authenticate the documents that they generate and allow other entities to verify them. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.

abstract={With the continuous development of block chain technology, people realize that this trusted underlying mechanism has important practical significance as the foundation of various activities. This paper combines block chain technology with sports health system, and improves it based on Ethereum system. In the traditional block chain system, the time to generate blocks is too slow and the centralization problem is caused by the large asset gap. We propose the concept of surplus advantage of account to determine which account has more power to generate the new block in the block chain. In this way, users of the system can maintain the system, which can further ensure the security of the whole system and the authenticity of data information, and greatly improve the efficiency of the whole system. And we write smart contracts to make sure that things always follow the agreed rules. This will also make the whole sports health system has better security and credibility. With this block chain technology as the guarantee of the underlying technology, the sports health system can be more accurate, the relevant departments for the implementation and supervision of sports health subsidies, but also ensure the authenticity and security of the data information. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={During the past decade, several misbehaving certificate authorities (CAs) have issued fraudulent TLS certificates allowing man-in-the-middle (MITM) kinds of attacks that result in serious security incidents. In order to avoid such incidents, Yakubov et al. ((2018) A blockchain-based PKI management framework. NOMS 2018 - 2018 IEEE/IFIP Network Operations and Management Symposium, Taipei, Taiwan, April, pp. 16. IEEE) recently proposed a new public key infrastructure (PKI) architecture where CAs issue, revoke and validate X.509 certificates on a public blockchain. However, in their proposal TLS clients are subject to MITM kinds of attacks, and certificate transparency is not fully provided. In this paper, we eliminate the issues of the Yakubov et al.'s scheme and propose a new PKI architecture based on permissioned blockchain with PBFT consensus mechanism where the consensus nodes utilize a dynamic threshold signature scheme to generate signed blocks. In this way, the trust to the intermediary entities can be completely eliminated during certificate validation. Our scheme enjoys the dynamic property of the threshold signature because TLS clients do not have to change the verification key even if the validator set is dynamic. We implement our proposal on private Ethereum network to demonstrate the experimental results. The results show that our proposal has negligible overhead during TLS handshake. The certificate validation duration is less than the duration in the conventional PKI and Yakubov et al.'s scheme. © 2020 The British Computer Society 2020. All rights reserved.

abstract={The publish and subscribe messaging model has proven itself as a dominant messaging paradigm for IoT systems. An example of such is the commonly used Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol. However, the security concerns with this protocol have presented vital security challenges in most IoT applications. For example, the MQTT protocol does not have secure authentication mechanisms implemented and leaves that task to the developer as all the included native security services are fragile. This paper will present a well-thought approach involving a lightweight authentication and authorization scheme together with a decentralized identity system to manage the users' identities. This mechanism helps in facilitating the authentication for both subscribers and publishers by utilizing a smart contract in Ethereum blockchain to guarantee trust, accountability and preserve user privacy. We provided a proof-of-concept implementation to prove our work, which involves a decentralized MQTT platform and dashboard using our approach. The usability of this approach was further analyzed, particularly concerning CPU and memory utilization. Our analysis proved that our approach satisfies IoT applications' requirements since it reduces the consumption of resources and that smart contracts help in the automation of data management processes. © 2021 ACM.},

abstract={Online Banking offers customers the accessibility of managing one's funds anytime, anywhere. However, any online transactions will be prone to security threats. Existing system uses two way authentication factor(OTP) that are easily cracked by cyber attackers leading to customers having their account details compromised while not having the provision of attacker's identification. Therefore in this paper we propose mobile SIM serial based verification system to secure mobile transactions on mobile devices with Blockchain based server side secure system. The subscriber identity module(sim) serial number is registered with the user's account and in case an intruder tries to initiate a transaction from some other sim, there arises a mismatch of the login credentials then system sends location information of the intruder to the bank. The bank then alerts the registered user by mailing them the intruder's details. Since the mobile sim serial number is unique to the sim and is not provided manually rather extracted, there is no possibility of intruder initiating the transaction from other device, thus overcoming the concerns related to OTP. The Ethereum Blockchain technology provides server side database security by verifying the digital signatures during the transaction and consensus algorithm for transaction confirmation. Blockchain based security is mathematically proved for secure Banking transaction. © 2021 American Institute of Physics Inc.. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Nowadays, vehicle theft has been increased drastically all over the world. The prevention of vehicle theft is essential to enhance vehicle security. A large number of vehicles have been stolen for the lack of essential foundation and administration of a secure platform. Several existing systems were developed to protect the vehicle from unauthorized access. But, they suffer from various limitations such as data security, the possibility of cybercriminals activities, leakage of personal information, and centralized System. We propose a vehicle theft detection framework using a decentralized and secure platform to increase the security level of the vehicle. Blockchain and smart contracts are used to provide the security of the stored data on the ledger and authenticate a genuine user automatically with greater accuracy. In this paper, we present 2-Step Authentication (2SA) and unauthorized access detection algorithms. The 2SA ensures the secure accessibility of the application by providing the randomly token chosen by the user. The proposed framework can provide vehicle security and owner’s privacy. In this proposed framework, more than one person can drive the vehicle authorizing by the vehicle owner without hampering stored data in the vehicle device. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The supply chain management industry is struggling with inadequate resources for efficient authenticity verification. Blockchain technology and smart contracts can overcome such conventional limitations to authenticate products in an easy, economical and secure manner. Decentralized and immutable blockchain systems allow product tracking to its origin.In this paper we have proposed and implemented a system for product authentication using blockchain technology based on ethereum platform by making use of smart contracts. We have analysed the existing centralized system and the need to shift from the existing centralized system to a decentralized blockchain based ledger technology. The use of blockchain technology in supply chain technology has reduced the complexity in product authentication by making the entire history of the product available from its production stage till it reaches the customer. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={With the rapid growth in the sector of information technology and easy access to cheap and advanced office instruments in the market, the faking of important documents has become a matter of concern nowadays. Therefore, the need for verification and authentication practices of various important documents in the form of banking documents, government documents, transaction documents, educational certificates etc is also increasing. However, various challenging and tedious processes have made document verification very complex and time-consuming which motivated us to conduct this research. In this paper, we present a decentralized web application for digital document verification using Ethereum blockchain-based technology in P2P cloud storage to enhance the verification process by making it more open, transparent, and auditable. The proposed model includes several methods such as public/private key cryptography, online storage security, digital signatures, hash, peer-to-peer networks and proof of work which has made the verification of any uploaded documents for any organization or authority faster and convenient with just a click. Furthermore, respective hash values are also assigned to each individual document. Our proposed model successfully meets up all the criteria for a digital document verification system by alleviating the gaps and difficulties in the traditional methods in document verification. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={The advent of 5G will bring a massive adoption of IoT devices across our society. IoT Applications (IoT Apps) will be the primary data collection base. This scenario leads to unprecedented scalability and security challenges, with one of the first areas for these applications being Smart Cities (SC). IoT devices in new network paradigms, such as Edge Computing and Fog Computing, will collect data from urban environments, providing real-time management information. One of these challenges is ensuring that the data sent from Edge Computing are reliable. Blockchain has been a technology that has gained the spotlight in recent years, due to its robust security in fintech and cryptocurrencies. Its strong encryption and distributed and decentralized network make it potential for this challenge. Using Blockchain with IoT makes it possible for SC applications to have security information distributed, which makes it possible to shield against Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS). IoT devices in an SC can have a long life, which increases the chance of having security holes caused by outdated firmware. Adding a layer of identification and verification of attributes and signature of messages coming from IoT devices by Smart Contracts can bring confidence in the content. SC Apps that extract data from legacy and outdated appliances, installed in inaccessible, unknown, and often untrusted urban environments can benefit from this work. Our work’s main contribution is the development of API Gateways to be used in IoT devices and network gateway to sign, identify, and authorize messages. For this, keys and essential characteristics of the devices previously registered in Blockchain are used. We will discuss the importance of this implementation while considering the SC and present a testbed that is composed of Blockchain Ethereum and real IoT devices. We analyze the transfer time, memory, and CPU impacts during the sending and processing of these messages. The messages are signed, identified, and validated by our API Gateways and only then collected for an IoT data management application. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={The efficiency of cooperative communication protocols to increase the reliability and range of transmission for Vehicular Ad hoc Network (VANET) is proven, but identity verification and communication security are required to be ensured. Though it is difficult to maintain strong network connections between vehicles because of there high mobility, with the help of cooperative communication, it is possible to increase the communication efficiency, minimise delay, packet loss, and Packet Dropping Rate (PDR). However, cooperating with unknown or unauthorized vehicles could result in information theft, privacy leakage, vulnerable to different security attacks, etc. In this paper, a blockchain based secure and privacy preserving authentication protocol is proposed for the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). Blockchain is utilized to store and manage the authentication information in a distributed and decentralized environment and developed on the Ethereum platform that uses a digital signature algorithm to ensure confidentiality, non-repudiation, integrity, and preserving the privacy of the IoVs. For optimized communication, transmitted services are categorized into emergency and optional services. Similarly, to optimize the performance of the authentication process, IoVs are categorized as emergency and general IoVs. The proposed cooperative protocol is validated by numerical analyses which show that the protocol successfully increases the system throughput and decreases PDR and delay. On the other hand, the authentication protocol requires minimum storage as well as generates low computational overhead that is suitable for the IoVs with limited computer resources. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={As the global trend of digitalization and automation constantly pushes our entire society forward, the library, as a gateway to both global knowledge and social culture, should by no means fall behind. However, instead of digitalizing the collections and book circulation processes, most libraries seem to focus their digitalization and automation endeavors on other services. We, on the other hand, would like to virtualize a library as operates on the very basis of electronic collections. Electronic books, often abbreviated to "E-books", are a better option that fits the reading habbit of many in the modern society. In creating a virtual library, we aim to design a user-friendly interface for easy, secure reader identity verification and e-book browsing and borrowing where no piracy can happen in case of the existence of a malicious user. We shall propose a new design based on the blockchain technology with smart contract that features distributed computing and data immutability. The new system is capable of solid user authentication as well as detialed e-book circulation history recording, and will offer the reader a smooth, comfortable e-book reading experience. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={The charity management system is a vital information management system. the information must be entirely open for society, and anyone has the right to supervise. Therefore, we use the characteristics of the blockchain to be tamper-proof, decentralized, autonomous, observable, verifiable, and information-sharing to develop a secure and robust charity information management system. Use the ring signature mechanism to protect the privacy of supervisors. A charity contract system was developed based on the Ethereum experimental environment, code the traditional charity text contract, storage and execution of contracts both are on the blockchain, which ensures the autonomy and reliability of the charity project and the trustworthiness and credibility. Our system is a novel innovation that can succeed the traditional public platform for charity. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={Traditional paper certificates have difficulties in preservation and management, causes tampering and forgery. A secure decentralized-based platform could mitigate the risk with-out any third-party intervention using Ethereum in the core. This work proposed a novel architecture to generate digital certificates using a distributed ledger automatically. Further, it authenticates the same using private keys with trusted certificate authorities. The framework is tested on FU540 (RISC-V) architecture. A detailed mechanism for generating and authenticating certificates is validated on FU540 board with blockchain integration. Mechanism flow starts with the admin. It adds the source organization blocks having the user detail records to the distributed ledger. Verifiers put the request to the source authorizer to perform verifications.

But in E-voting also, it is essential to maintain the privacy, confidentiality and integrity of the votes and voters, which is challenging. The blockchain technology that has triggered the start of a new era in the digital world is one possible solution. The immutability property and decentralized architecture of blockchain technology make it suitable to create a robust and secure E-voting system. It helps in conducting the elections by maintaining authentication, integrity, transparency, confidentiality and non-repudiation in the system. In this paper, we have evaluated the potential and feasibility of the blockchain system for electronic voting. We have addressed all the possible limitations in the current E-voting system. Using solidity language, we have implemented a small-scale sample E-voting system as a smart contract that includes everything from hosting the election, verifying the voters and counting the votes and have deployed it on an external network. The paper also shows how Zero-Knowledge Proof can help in creating privacy-preserving secure E-voting systems. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={The rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT) has promoted the wide adoption of mobile medical devices, which monitor patients' body conditions in real-time. The collected health-related data are highly sensitive, requiring careful protection during the accessing and transmission for specialized analysis. Yet, existing efforts either rely on centralized authentication for the numerous end devices or are designed to be partially distributed for a closed institution, both lacking scalability for mobile healthcare scenarios. In this paper, we propose HealthTrust that provides a generalized and flexible authentication scheme for distributed medical devices in the cross-institution context. With blockchain as the building block, HealthTrust jointly exploits smart contracts and secure authentication to attain controlled transmission and secure exchanging of healthcare data between institutions. We have implemented the system functions with a prototype based on Ethereum. Experimental results and safety analysis demonstrate that HealthTrust can well satisfy both the safety and feasibility requirements. © 2021 IEEE.},

The smart contract is implemented to control the access privilege and the modified version of IPFS software is utilized to enforce the predefined access-control list. An application framework on a secure decentralized file sharing system is presented in combination with IPFS and PKI to secure file sharing. PKI having public and private keys is used to enable encryption and decryption of every file transaction and authentication of identities through Metamask to cryptographically recognize account ownership in the Blockchain system. A gas consumption-based result analysis is done in the private Ethereum network and it attains transparency, security managed access, and quality of data indicating better efficacy of this work. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={Aiming at the problems of user privacy leakage, digital signature denial and tracking in the current digital signature electronic voting system, a blockchain electronic voting scheme based on SM9 partial blind signature is proposed. The use of partial blind signature can effectively resist signature denial and tracking. The problem is to introduce a trusted third party to prevent attackers from tampering with information, and at the same time use blockchain technology to replace voting and vote counting functions, which solves the drawbacks of the centralized system. The security analysis proves that the solution can meet the security requirements of the electronic voting protocol, improve the security and voter's sense of trust in the voting system, and reduce the voting cost. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={Many countries have been using online voting systems instead of ballot papers. In such voting systems, voters can cast votes online using their cell phones, laptops, and other internet-connected devices. Online voting systems have centralized databases where a malicious attacker can hack, change or manipulate the database. Therefore, current online voting systems present a security concern for any government. Blockchain is a peer-to-peer technology in which data is stored in a tamper-proof ledger and maintained by participating peers. In this paper, we propose a secure online voting system using Ethereum Blockchain and Ethereum Smart Contracts. A voter can cast her vote securely after scanning her fingerprint and iris recognition. Our proposed methodology uses Paillier homomor-phic encryption and the private key shifting technique to ensure voter privacy and identity security. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={IoT devices do not possess the potential to protect themselves from risk of the attackers as they are resource-constrained. Blockchain is arising as a decentralized and distributed technology with proficiency in delivering secure management, access control and user authentication for protecting data and services of IoT devices, guaranteeing integrity, confidentiality and availability. IoT-based healthcare applications has many benefits like reduced cost of healthcare, improved quality, remote monitoring of patients etc. Ensuring a robust and secure interactions between patient and healthcare providers is very important to protect sensitive medical data. A distributed and reliable user authentication and access control scheme to be used in IoT based Healthcare is designed and implemented here with the help of local gateways directly interfaced to smart contract based Ethereum Blockchain. The local gateways can manage multiple local IoT devices and improve scalability. This reduces the overhead of performing resource-consuming authentication tasks and blockchain-communication at the IoT devices. To exhibit the working of the framework, a case study is presented with two laptops and a Raspberry Pi. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={In-Patient Monitoring, data sharing is fundamental step to get the comprehension from earlier research-oriented work. Traditional data-sharing policies rely on third-party holders that can compromise the system transparency, trust, and integrity. To solve the aforementioned issues, we have proposed a smart contract-based secure data sharing scheme in healthcare 5.0 by leveraging the advantages of the interplanetary file system (IPFS). The proposed scheme achieves data confidentiality, integrity, and access control rules by implementing active entities' access control policy written in a smart contract. Entities are first authenticated using digital signatures. Afterwards, the completion of treatment initiated the transaction and transferred the amount to the requested entities. This scheme integrates Ethereum blockchain (BCN), decentralized storage, and incentive schemes. In this scheme, smart contracts are written in solidity language and deployed on the Ethereum-based test network. The proposed scheme achieves data integrity, confidentiality, authentication, and non-repudiation. The result section calculates the communication and computation cost of 1408 bits and 0.112 ms, respectively. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={Content Quality Assessment and Rewarding mechanisms are posited as critical variables to improve content quality standards and compensate high-quality contributors. Content authenticity, quality, and relevancy appear to be among the more significant challenges with traditional content platforms. A novel trend in the technology space known as blockchain has been found to address these challenges. The consensus protocols associated with blockchain provide many benefits over traditional mechanisms on the frontiers of privacy, security, and decentralization. However, while these protocols provide consensus on rewards and transactions, they do not fully address content quality. More specifically, the issues around equal voting power are often not entirely consistent regarding voting weight. In this paper, a novel Content Quality Assessment and Rewarding Mechanisms (CARM) is proposed to address the variables of content quality. The system uses CQ Score, a Content Quality Assessment Framework via the Ethereum Blockchain and Smart Contracts to ensure that user variables such as completeness, authenticity, and relevancy are used to qualify content quality. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper we propose a comprehensive and scalable framework to build secure-by-design e-voting systems. Decentralization, transparency, determinism, and untamperability of votes are granted by dedicated smart contracts on a blockchain, while voter authenticity and anonymity are achieved through (provable secure) linkable ring signatures. These, in combination with suitable smart contract constraints, also grant protection from double voting. Our design is presented in detail, focusing on its security guarantees and the design choices that allow it to scale to a large number of voters. Finally, we present a proof-of-concept implementation of the proposed framework, made available as open source. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={The traditional public key infrastructure (PKI) issues certificates by trusted certification authority (CA). But due to the centralized structure of CA, it brings some problems, such as single-point failure, certificate opacity and so on. Another decentralized system web of trust (WOT) has a high access threshold. In addition, WOT cannot ensure the authenticity of users' authentication because of lack of incentive, and it cannot authenticate the specific user identity. In this paper, we propose a new distributed identification system based on blockchain, called VAPKI. This system is implemented through smart contracts on Ethereum, which is transparent and immutable. Meanwhile, it can authenticate the fine-grained attributes of user identity and strengthen the authenticity of user identity through transparent authentication. In addition, VAPKI can identify the malicious user through the regular validation tasks (RVTs). In addition, it realizes the credit and deposit mechanism, ensuring users to be honest and trustworthy. This mechanism can also force users to authenticate strictly and punish malicious users found in RVTs. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={Blockchain-based crowdfunding is one of the new, upcoming alternatives to the traditional centralized approach to crowdfunding. Traditional crowdfunding platforms are vulnerable to data leaks, high transaction and platform fees, and rampant frauds which happens due to the anonymity of user's identity i.e., users cannot be identified when they commit cybercrimes. As blockchain is immutable and decentralized, it can reduce the possibility of data breaches. This brings in transparency as there is no central authority over the blockchain-based crowdfunding system. This paper attempts to solve these existing issues with the aid of a digital identity management system with an underlying Blockchain system. By implementing blockchain in a digital identity management system, malicious users can be identified and action can be taken against them. This paper explores donation-based crowdfunding using Ethereum as a framework and has been tested on the Rinkeby Test Network. This system can conduct several crowdfunding campaigns simultaneously. This paper explains the smart contract written in Solidity language in detail. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={In today’s world we are surrounded with lot of IoT devices and sensors. This IoT devices has made our life easier and more comfortable utilizing the Blockchain and increase the security and efficiency of network. key features of Blockchain will bring resistance to unauthorized modification and devices. The Rapid development in this technology of IoT is getting into pool and Rapid more data is transmitted and process over the communication channels. As a result, these devices is deployed worldwide and even more advanced requirement in the practical application and performance. Most of the devices are highly centralized architecture and which then suffers from technical limitation as well as they suffer from cyber attacks. To solve this problem, we propsed a system in which a gateway is introduced. The role of the Gateway in smartphones is the most beneficial, yet it is a unified structure that presents many security issues such as integrity, certification and availability. This network consists of three levels, including smart home devices, gateways and clouds. Blockchain infrastructure is provided in the gateway layer so that data can be processed and shared as blocks. Blockchain guarantees the confidentiality of internal data outside smart homes and the availability by way of authentic communication between the application of the network for Ethereum-based Blockchain technologies, including time and precision, to promote decentralization and overcome the central architecture issue. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={Blockchain is an innovation that's prized for its capacity to record and disperse exchanges in the permanent, scumbled record. In a traditional supply chain, there is no procedure where consumers can be assured about the authenticity of the products as there is no way to probe the hygienist and authenticity. The purpose of this research is to build a decentralized, Blockchain-based system to check the product's quality and source. To verify the authenticity of the goods, we will create a certified organic food supply chain system. In this paper, we are going to describe how to strengthen the security of data of supply chain members by applying blockchain technology. We will reduce the riskiness of data tampering and fraud data allocation by the 'Smart contract' using blockchain technology and by providing a quality assurance certificate customers can be sure of the product quality. This article assists individuals from many industries in understanding the advantages of the blockchain-based system and implementing it to increase the efficiency of the entire system. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={Blockchain and machine learning (ML) have emerged as two disruptive technologies that could transform various sectors. Blockchain is known as peer to peer decentralized, distributed ledger technology that enables to store and exchange anything of value, it is deterministic, permanent and immutable. On the other hand, ML is the ability of computers to learn without being programmed, and it is probabilistic. Hence, when blockchain and ML converge, they surely would benefit from each other. Blockchain can enhance security of ML platforms, and ML can provide automation and optimization to the blockchain solutions. In this work, we advocate the importance of enhancing blockchain with ML algorithms, as a proof of principle we address the issue of secure and intelligent e-voting.The use of blockchain technology has brought tremendous different application domains, e-voting is one of them. Most existing e-Voting systems require central authority during the process of authentication and verification of the voter. In this paper we propose a safe online voting approach based on blockchain and ML to provide a solution to this issue. We use blockchain to ensure integrity and transparency of the votes, and ML for automating the verification process of eligible voters based on AI-powered oracle platform for face authentication. The proposed solution offers automation, security, and mobility to the voting system. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is the principal signalling protocol in Voice over IP (VoIP) systems, responsible for initialising, terminating, and maintaining sessions amongst call parties. However, the problem with the SIP protocol is that it was not designed to be secure by nature as the HTTP digest authentication used in SIP is insecure, making it vulnerable to a variety of attacks. The current solutions rely on several standardised encryption protocols, such as TLS and IPsec, to protect SIP registration messages. However, the current centralised solutions do not scale well and cause algorithm overload when encoding and decoding SIP messages. In trying to rectify this issue, we propose in this paper a blockchain-based lightweight authentication mechanism, which involves a decentralised identity model to authenticate the SIP client to the SIP server. Our mechanism uses a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain to ensure trust, accountability and preserves user privacy. We provided a proof-of-concept implementation to demonstrate our work. Further analysis of this approach's usability, mainly CPU and memory usage, was conducted comparing to IPsec and TLS. Then we discussed our system's security and presented a security analysis. Our analysis proves that our approach satisfies the SIP protocol security requirements. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={The innovative development in the internet of things is not only giving rapid growth in the development of efficiency of new technologies but also giving a threat relative to the integrity and confidentiality of data. So, it requires security, privacy, data integrity, confidentiality, authentication and authorization which is provided by the Blockchain Technology. This paper mainly represents access control mechanism for different nodes in the smart healthcare environment. For this it uses multiple access control smart contracts. Here the smart contract is implemented using Ethereum Smart Contract increasing the confidentiality and integrity of data by providing Authentication, Access control, Authorization for the management of data sharing and storage of data. Here the smart contracts will provide Node Authentication and authorization of each device, based on the registration to provide the data security which is missing in other Internet of Thing's applications. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={Although nearly all information regarding smart contract addresses is shared via websites, emails, or other forms of digital communication, blockchains and distributed ledger technologies are unable to establish secure bindings between websites and the corresponding smart contracts. A user cannot differentiate between a website link to a legitimate smart contract set up by a reputable business owner and that to an illicit contract aiming to defraud the user. Surprisingly, current attempts to resolve this issue are based mostly on information redundancy, e.g., displaying contract addresses multiple times in varying forms of images and text. These verification processes are burdensome because the user is responsible for verifying the accuracy of an address. More importantly, these measures do not address the core problem because the contract itself does not contain information on its authenticity. To resolve such limitations and to increase security, we propose a solution that leverages publicly issued Transport Layer Security (TLS)/Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificates of Fully-Qualified Domain Names (FQDN) to ensure the authenticity of smart contracts and their owners. Our approach combines on-chain endorsement storage that utilizes signatures from the respective certificate and off-chain authentication of the smart contract. The system is open and transparent because the only requirement for usage is ownership of a TLS/SSL certificate. Further, moderate deployment and maintenance costs, a widely accepted public key infrastructure, and a simple interface enable TLS/SSL endorsed smart contracts (TeSC) to bridge the gap between websites and smart contracts. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={In many blockchain networks, light nodes (e.g. mobile clients) with few computational resources must rely on more powerful full nodes to retrieve transactions from the chain. However, in this untrusted environment a malicious full node could deliver altered or incomplete information, requiring query authentication techniques to ensure the integrity of the results. To this aim, we study an authentication mechanism for spatial information (i.e. data representing the location, size, and shape of objects in a geographical coordinate system). We assume that light nodes issue range queries to obtain data from a single block. To enable authentication, we propose to construct a Merkle R-tree for each block and embed its root into the corresponding header, so that full nodes can exploit it to fetch information and construct a proof of integrity for lightweight clients. We also develop a new algorithm based on sorting and partitioning for constructing Merkle R-trees from a set of spatial transactions and employ space-filling curves to preserve the locality of elements. We examine its theoretical complexity, evaluate it experimentally on a real data set and compare it against other popular construction strategies. Results show that, as queries become more selective, trees generated with our solution improve query performance and reduce verification times with respect to other approaches. Moreover, we observe that the overhead induced by the tree construction is negligible if compared to the average inter-block time of popular blockchain protocols such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={The massive adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) has caused an increasing demand for electric energy to charge the vehicles. Efficiently managing energy trading between energy providers and energy consumers can lead to meet the high demand for charging EVs while reducing its cost compared to traditional power provided by the utility company. However, a large portion of the existing systems leveraged for trading energy between EVs are centralized and fall short in providing transparency, reliability, audit, security, and trustworthy features. In this paper, we propose blockchain-based energy trading using an auctioning and reputation scheme. We develop Ethereum smart contracts which enable owners of EVs to automatically request electricity to charge their vehicles in a reliable, cost-effective, secure, and trustworthy manner. The proposed approach ensures the lowest rate available by implementing a reverse auctioning scheme for fair competition between providers to provide the requested service at the lowest cost. The proposed solution enforces high quality of service through a reputation-based approach that quantifies the performance of the service providers and gives an advantage to more reputable providers. We present the implementation details of the deployed system on a test Ethereum blockchain platform. We perform system testing and evaluation to validate and assess the functionality and performance of the proposed solution. Furthermore, we present security and cost analyses to show the affordability, robustness, and practicality of the proposed approach. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Diabetes is a metabolic disorder caused by high blood sugar levels, which can harm the kidneys, the heart, the eyes, and blood vessels. During the Covid-19 pandemic, diabetes patients were most affected. In the existing healthcare system, medical data is available in paper form or through a central server. Accessing the data from the central system and sharing it with all stakeholders would be a critical task during the pandemic. This research work deals with the design and implementation of a diabetes blockchain consortium. It can help all healthcare stakeholders to efficiently prioritize the needs of diabetes patients during a pandemic, such as oxygen beds, vaccinations, diabetes compensation, telemedicine, 5G-integrated remote location support, and other related records. The Ethereum sandbox simulation design is utilized to secure diabetes patients' healthcare records. The Interplanetary file system (IPFS) encrypts health data and sends it to the blockchain to ensure the privacy of personal healthcare information. The NEM symbol blockchain is used to develop this consortium as a proof-of-concept (PoC) model. Each stakeholder in a consortium is assigned NEM generated QR code to track records as a distributed ledger. A smart contract designed to run the diabetes blockchain application. Attribute-based encryption (ABE) authenticates users and restricts malicious nodes. Certainly, this research suggests aggregation of transactions and blocks in the blockchain, which would increase transaction speed, minimize transaction fees, and consume less power in a future blockchain design. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={Traditional insurance policy settlement is a manual process that is never hassle-free. There are many issues, such as hidden conditions from the insurer or fraud claims by the insured, making the settlement process rough. This process also consumes a significant amount of time that makes the process very inefficient. This whole scenario can be disrupted by the implementation of blockchain and smart contracts in insurance. Blockchain and innovative contract technology can provide immutable data storage, security, transparency, authenticity, and security while any transaction process is triggered. With the implementation of blockchain, the whole insurance process, from authentication to claim settlement, can be done with more transparency and security. A blockchain is a virtual chain of data blocks that is a decentralized technology. Any transaction or change in the blocks is done after the decentralized validator entity, not a single person. The smart contract is a unique facility stored on the blockchain that gets executed when the predetermined conditions are met. This paper presents a framework where smart contracts are used for insurance contracts and stored on blockchain. In the case of a claim, if all the predetermined conditions are met, the transaction happens; otherwise, it is discarded. The conditions are immutable. That means there is scope for alteration from either side. This blockchain and intelligent contract-based framework are hosted on a private Ethereum network. The Solidity programming language is used to create smart contracts. The framework uses the Proof of Authority (PoA) consensus algorithm to validate the transactions. In the case of any faulty transaction request, the consensus algorithm acts according to and cancels the claim. With blockchain and smart contract implementation, this framework can solve all the trust and security issues that rely on a standard insurance policy. © 2021 Abid Hassan et al.},

abstract={Health information exchange (HIE) refers to the integrated management and secure sharing of health information among healthcare entities. HIE improves healthcare quality and streamlines healthcare administrative work. These advantages have propelled health-care stakeholders to implement HIE. However, challenged by issues such as security, privacy, and costs, HIE is not widespread. Recent studies have suggested blockchain-based HIE for solving security and privacy issues. Unfortunately, existing blockchain-based HIE studies do not consider the privacy issues caused by analyzing senders and receivers of transactions in the blockchain. In this work, we suggest MEXchange, a novel blockchain-based privacy-preserving HIE that prevents the privacy issue by obscuring the sender and concealing receiver addresses. We propose smart contracts and workflow that use ring signature and stealth address for blockchain-based HIE. Software components and implementation of MEXchange on the Ethereum private network are discussed. We evaluate MEXchange quantitatively by measuring the transaction latency and throughput of exchanging. Also, we evaluate MEXchange qualitatively using the requirements of the Office of National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC). Moreover, we proceed with threat modeling based on STRIDE. Finally, we compare MEXchange with Ancile, FHIRChain, Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise Cross-Enterprise Document Sharing (IHE XDS), and MedRec. The MEXchange lowers barriers to the application of blockchain-based HIE systems by mitigating privacy and security issues among healthcare stakeholders. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={With the advancing technologies become tools for illicit activities and avoid detection, digital forensics is necessary for law enforcement in modern criminal investigations. In order to maintain the integrity and authenticity of the evidence, a chain of custody is essential for the successful prosecution of criminals in court. However, it is a great challenge to manage the preservation and collection of digital evidence because of its fragile and volatile in nature. Blockchain has been proposed as a promising and reliable technology to provide immutability and traceability of digital content, however, the applications of blockchain to the law enforcement agencies (LEAs) requires special attention to the security issue. In this research, we proposed a blockchain of custody framework to facilitate the security and transparency of digital evidence in criminal investigation process. The framework is implement on Ethereum smart contract to support authenticity and integrity of digital evidence in preliminary investigation, case management and court phases. We also propose the role of investigator to leverage access control in evidence creation, transferring and modification. The corresponding actions with judicial process is simulated using private ethereum blockchain. The experimental results indicate that the proposed framework can prevent digital evidence been tampered or contaminated and assure its legal defensibility with rigorous privilege management. Moreover, by successfully synchronizing digital evidence transactions to multiple nodes ensures the accountability of evidence data for every involved law enforcement agency. © 2021 The Authors.

abstract={The most shocking events were was the recent discovery of the fraudulent activities in the Punjab National Bank. This is due to frequent systemic failures that detect human errors. Blockchain technology is the greatest solution for this issue. It is surprisingly common for the information settlement mechanism like SWIFT to be on a isolated ledger from the payment settlement mechanism. If the banks uses a ledger that stores information settlement distributed across all the participants, then the fraudulent user may reflect on all the available participants in the transactions, auditors and regulators. Our Paper is a Decentralised Loan Management Web Application (DApp) built on Ethereum blockchain which targets on preventing such fraudulent attacks on Loans sanctions by decentralising the processes. The security features authentication of the user identity, authentication of bank officials and multiple levels of verification of details are implemented using Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). © 2021 The authors and IOS Press.},

abstract={In blockchain systems, the lack of established identity management processes pose a problem for applications requiring smart contract owners to be authenticated. One issue that previously proposed solutions face is the accumulation of a critical mass of trusted data that makes the system usable. In this work, we propose an identity assertion and verification framework for Ethereum that overcomes this bootstrapping problem. It achieves this by leveraging TLS certificates, which are part of the established infrastructure that is commonly used for authenticating internet connections. We design and implement an TLS certificate-based authentication framework whose key features are the smart contract-based validation and storage of certificates and address-identity bindings. Looking at the current TLS ecosystem, we find that a large share of all domain certificates is issued by a small number of intermediate and root certificates. Therefore, we decide to store and maintain certificates in one smart contract to minimize processing costs. The evaluation of our prototype implementation shows that the associated cost of our system is within a feasible operating range, with the costs of submitting a new certificate currently averaging around $1.81 and the cost of creating an address-identity binding averaging around $1.32. Our system is a pragmatic and, most importantly, quickly bootstrapped method for an identity assertion and verification framework for Ethereum. © 2021, International Financial Cryptography Association.},

abstract={The issuance of fraud certificates has become an unrestrained and unchecked problem around the globe, because of its inevitable simplicity. A fake academic certificate can be defined as a counterfeit degree from a legitimate or even an illegitimate university. As a result, companies end up spending millions of dollars to simply verify the legitimacy of the certificates and transcripts of the applicants. Blockcerts, MIT Lab project, presented a solution, but their design was based on the Bitcoin chain which limited the scope of the project and left several functionalities unaddressed. Our approach implements a technique that uses the Blockchain (Ethereum) technology that can implement functional logic, to solve this issue. The two major advantages of Blockchain are that the verification can be done through an application and authentication or verification can occur instantaneously once the certificate holder approves the access. Also, the records cannot tamper as changes to individual blocks can be done only with the approval of all the parties processing the block. For years now, we have been relying on just a password to be the guardian of our most confidential information. In today’s modern world, this has become the greatest threat to our security. Passwords are very easily decodable and can be cracked in just a matter of seconds, while users are being subjected to phishing scams with alarming regularity. A way to reduce this security threat is two factor-based authentication. Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a type of multi-factor authentication method which confirms a users claimed identity by utilizing a combination of two different components, instead of one. This paper is on issuing certificates, verification and proposed decentralized two factor-based authentication feature using the Ethereum smart contract, which makes the entire authentication process even more secure. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={With the recent emergence of the smart healthcare era, and patients relying more on personalized health monitoring based on Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices; patients&#x2019; lives are becoming highly threatened in case they fall victim to counterfeit devices. Thus, verifying whether these body sensors utilized are authentic and reliable in an unimpeachable, credible, and auditable manner without any centralized management is of crucial importance. Furthermore, manipulating data and hijacking in an IoMT context are also of tremendous criticality. Motivated by the aforementioned challenges, in this article, a smart contract-based scalable authentication scheme dedicated for IoMT devices is proposed. The scheme mitigates the deficiencies of the traditional established systems that are extensively built on centralized approaches, vulnerable to distributed denial of service attacks, by leveraging blockchain&#x2019;s decentralization and security properties. The scheme ensures confidentiality, anonymity, and privacy as it is built on a consortium blockchain and integrity by offering secure firmware updates and protects patients from counterfeit devices by leveraging the physical unclonable function. The authentication approach was implemented on Ethereum and evaluated with regard to its computation and communication costs to prove its feasibility and effectiveness as well as its security by presenting a formal analysis using ProVerif.

abstract={The vehicular announcement is an essential component of the Intelligent Transport System that enables vehicles to share important road information to reduce road congestion, traffic incidents, and environmental pollution. Due to the multiple security issues like single point of failure, data tampering, and false information dissemination, many researchers have proposed Blockchain (BC) based solutions to ensure data correctness and transparency in the vehicular networks. However, these schemes suffer from high computational cost and storage overhead due to the use of unsuitable BC on the vehicular layer, costly authentication schemes, and inefficient digital signature verification methods. Moreover, the privacy leakage can occur due to publicly available reputation values and lack of pseudonyms update mechanism. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving hybrid BC based vehicular announcement scheme to enable secure and efficient announcement dissemination. We use IOTA Tangle to enable the benefits of BC on vehicular layer while reducing the storage and computational cost. We employ Elliptic Curve Cryptography based pseudonym update mechanism for hiding the real identities of vehicles. To prevent false information dissemination in the network, we propose a reputation-based incentive mechanism for encouraging the users to provide honest ratings about the announcement messages. Furthermore, we use Cuckoo Filter to enable lightweight trustworthiness verification of the vehicles without revealing their reputation values. We also employ a batch verification mechanism to reduce the delays caused by digital signature verification. Moreover, we use InterPlanetary File System, and Ethereum BC for ensuring data availability and secure trust management. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our proposed scheme to prove its efficiency. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={This paper presents a Validation and Verification (V&V) model of Data Marketplaces. Data is extracted from the sensors embedded within the Smart city, infrastructure, or building via Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and inserted into a Data Marketplace. The technology is based on smart contracts deployed on a private ethereum blockchain. Current issues with data in Smart cities, infrastructure, buildings, or any real estate, are the difficulty of its access and retrieval, therefore integration; its quality in terms of meaningful information; its large quantity with a reduced coverage in terms of systems and finally its authenticity, as data can be manipulated for economic advantage. In order to address these issues, this paper proposes a Data Marketplace model with a hierarchical process for data validation and verification where each stage adds a layer of data abstraction, value-added services and authenticity based on Artificial Intelligence. By using a blockchain, this presented approach is based on a decentralised method where each stakeholder stores the data. The proposed model is validated in a real application with live data: Newcastle urban observatory smart city project. © 2021, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.},

abstract={Vehicular crowd sensing is a promising approach to address the problem of traffic data collection by leveraging the power of vehicles. In various applications of vehicular crowd sensing, there exist two burning issues. First, privacy can be easily compromised when a vehicle is performing a crowd sensing task. Second, vehicles have no incentive to submit high-quality data due to the lack of fairness, which means that everyone gets the same paid, regardless of the quality of the submitted data. To address these issues, we propose a smart privacy-preserving incentive mechanism (SPPIM) for vehicular crowd sensing. Specifically, we first propose a new SPPIM model for the scenario of vehicular crowd sensing via smart contract on the blockchain. Then, we design a privacy-preserving incentive mechanism based on budget-limited reverse auction. Anonymous authentication based on zero-knowledge proof is utilized to ensure the privacy preservation of vehicles. To ensure fairness, the reward payments of winning vehicles are determined by not only the bids of vehicles but also their reputation and the data quality. Then, any rewarded vehicle can get the fair payment; on the contrary, malicious vehicles or task initiators will be punished. Finally, SPPIM is implemented by using smart contracts written via Solidity on a local Ethereum blockchain network. Both security analysis and experimental results show that the proposed SPPIM achieves privacy preservation and fair incentives at acceptable execution costs. © 2021 Lingling Wang et al.},

abstract={Ethereum is one of the oldest examples of blockchain technology provides a system that converts centralized storage to distributed and records transactions by way of decentralized and not by a centralized system and can be verified by each node, therefore it is suitable for storing fingerprints from official diploma documents and transcripts that are published. Smart contract is needed for making contract transactions to Ethereum with programming code, so contracts such as diplomas and transcripts uploaded on the Ethereum blockchain can distribute and produce diploma validation and the authenticity of transcripts with transaction hash, consensus, and comply with ERC-721 token standardization. The results showed that a sample of 5 electronic documents in pdf format with a transaction speed of 1 second on each file that were published and secured with Ethereum blockchain technology can be easily verified for authenticity, the system proposed and developed by us takes in consideration invalid and failure cases by giving the necessary feedback to the user. © 2021, the author(s).},

abstract={The advent of agro-industrialization has helped the agricultural food supply chain (AFSC) in introducing ease and innovation to other facets. In addition, Blockchain (BC) technology is revolutionizing each distributed data-related application by adding authentication and trust among the system's stakeholders. Inspired by the above-mentioned argument, this article proposes a system, KRanTi, to promote the supply chain of agricultural food by BC embedding across the 5G network. The 5G network upgrades the data connectivity by enhancing network infrastructure efficiency. In KRanTi, we present an efficient credit system that enables associated farmers to purchase the requisite agricultural raw product of higher quality without the pressure of instant payment. A score-based farm-food quality assurance system is then proposed, which guarantees optimal quality grading. Trust, transparency, and traceability are preserved through the implementation of Smart Contracts (SC) distributed across public Ethereum BC. The cost-effective off-line data storage service in AFSC is offered through the use of the Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS), a shared storage system to hold all data from stakeholders. Results show that the efficiency of the proposed scheme KRanTi is improved compared with traditional schemes with metrics such as less than 1 millisecond latency with 99.99% reliability compared with LTE with 5G, scalability, packet failure ratio, BC performance, cost-quality ratio, and data storage contrast. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={Image authentication is an important field that employs many different approaches and has several significant applications. In the proposed approach, we used a combination of two techniques to achieve authentication. Image watermarking is one of the techniques that has been used in many studies but the authentication field still needs to be studied. Blockchain technology is a relatively new technology that has significant research potential related to image authentica-tion. The watermark is embedded into the third-level discrete wavelet transform (DWT) in the middle frequency regions to achieve security and imperceptibility goals. Peak signal-to-noise ratio PSNR, structural similarity matrix (SSIM), nor-malized correlation coefficient (NCC), and bit error rate (BER) are used to measure the performance of image watermarking. We used blockchain technology to avoid involving a trusted third party for authentication. Secure Hash Algorithm 256 (SHA-256) is applied on the watermark to save it into the blockchain. The watermark is encrypted using Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and embedded into the image. The proposed method is tested on the USP SICI database and the MedPix medical image database. Ethereum blockchain is used to provide security, anonymity, and integrity of data with no third-party intervention. The proposed solution demonstrates enhanced security for image authentication compared with the state-of-the-art. © 2021, Tech Science Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Since the Tactile Internet has been considered as a new era of Internet, delivering real-time interactive systems as well as ultra-reliable and ultra-responsive network connectivity, tremendous efforts have been made to ensure authentication between communication's parties to secure remote surgery. Since this human to machine interaction like remote surgery is critical and the communication between the surgeon and the tactile actor i.e. robot arms should be fully protected during the surgical procedure, a fully secure mutual user authentication scheme should be used in order to establish a secure session among the communicating parties. The existing methods usually require a server to ensure the authentication among the communicating parties, which makes the system vulnerable to single of point failure and not fit the design of such critical distributed environment i.e. tactile internet. To address these issues, we propose a new decentralized blockchain based authentication solution for tactile internet. In our proposed solution, there is no need for a trusted party; moreover, the decentralized nature of our proposed solution makes the authentication immutable, efficient, secure, and low latency requirement. The implementation of our proposed solution is deployed on Ethereum official test network Ropsten. The experimental results show that our solution is efficient, highly secured, and flexible. © 2021.

abstract={With the increase of smart factories and smart cities following the recent 4th industrial revolution, internal user authentication and authorization have become an important issue. The user authentication model using the server-client structure has a problem of forgery of the access history caused by the log manipulation of the administrator and unclearness of the responsibility. In addition, users must independently manage the authentication method for each service authentication. In this paper, to solve the above problem, the researchers propose an integrated ID model based on a hybrid blockchain. The proposed model is implemented as two layers of Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric: the former layer is responsible for integrated authentication, and the latter layer is responsible for access control. The physical pass or application for user authentication and authorization are integrated to one ID through the proposed model. In addition, the decentralized blockchain ensures the integrity and transparency of the stored access history, and it also provides non-repudiation of authority and access history. © 2021 ASTES Publishers.

abstract={Electronic Medical Record or EMR are very sensitive data for the patients as well as the hospitals and government organizations. Now a days the data of patients are stored in the medical local storage which are very vulnerable to the invaders and hackers as the data security and privacy threat are high. In addition, these centralized systems lack interoperability and access limitation. So, we propose an EMR system that can control the access management and storage via Blockchain, Ethereum. From IPFS we use the IPFS hash to the transaction into the block of the Blockchain. Together with IPFS, IDS and a Customized Authenticator Service (CAS) we propose a model for authentication and integrity management. The CAS provides two-way authentication for the authorized users making the model more secure. IDS check the signature of the incoming request and notify the system about threats. Security analysis shows that our system works is a secure and effective way for data sharing for EMRs. © 2021 IEEE.},

abstract={While the first decentralized cryptocurrency system, Bitcoin, has run successfully since it was launched in 2009, the underlying technology, blockchain, now draws increasing attention. Based on the unique decentralization and trusted features of blockchain, it is possible to build a value-connected platform. However, the Bitcoin white paper does not provide a rigorous definition of blockchain. Meanwhile, prior related work mainly introduces high level concepts in blockchain, ignoring the important technique details. To provide an in-depth introduction of blockchain, this survey first extracts the blockchain technology from specific application scenarios, breaks the blockchain architecture into five core layers, and elaborates on the data, network, and consensus layers. More specifically, we introduce state-of-the-art techniques of three main components of a blockchain system: cryptography, consensus algorithm, and network in detail. We firstly introduce basic cryptographic tools involved in blockchain systems, such as hash calculation, Merkle tree, digital signature, elliptic curve digital signature algorithm(ECDSA), ring signature algorithm, zero-knowledge proof, and anti-quantum cryptographic algorithm. We then summarize the mainstream consensus processes involved in the existing systems and refine the consensus framework. Users can choose different consensus components to build their own consensus models according to the characteristics of the application scenarios. The end of the consensus section introduces the methods for modeling consensus algorithms abstractly and the two approaches used to formally prove and analyze the essential features of consensus models. Further, we introduce the network topologies and common network protocols adopted in blockchain systems. In addition, we introduce three hot issues related to blockchain, which are privacy protection, common attack schemes and capacity expansion. The paper analyzes the existing research results on the anonymity of Bitcoin, and then introduces three options to enhance its privacy: mixed currency, ring signature and zero knowledge proof. The existing attack schemes are divided into two categories in the paper, one based on the consensus model adopted by the system, and the other based on the network. We summarize the existing blockchain expansion schemes as single-chain extensions and cross-chain extensions, and analyze the two types in detail. At last, the current application situation and technical prospects of blockchain are introduced. We introduce three phases of the development of blockchain application, namely the digital currency, smart contract and new extensions in other areas. We compared different digital currencies in terms of purpose, distribution method, consensus algorithm and other aspects. We select three typical systems, Ethereum, Hyperledger and Enterprise Operation System(EOS), as the examples to show how to build smart contracts. Blockchain has made significant impact on the innovation and evolution of various fields, especially in the areas of Internet of Things, medical and public key infrastructure. Compared with other blockchain surveys, this survey summarizes and refines the papers in the blockchain field rather than a simple combination of prior work. For example, in the introduction to the consensus module, we extract a general framework from many existing consensus models. We split the consensus instances in different systems according to the hierarchy of the framework, and extract the components that are necessary for building a consensus model. Based on this survey, readers are able to understand the development of blockchain quickly and can explore in depth according to their respective needs. © 2021, Science Press. All right reserved.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) providers serve better IoT services each year while producing more IoT gateways and devices to expand their services. However, the security of the IoT ecosystem remains an afterthought for most IoT providers. This action results in many cybersecurity breaches in the field, most likely due to the lack of access control mechanisms. In this paper, we propose BorderChain, an access control framework based on blockchain for IoT endpoints. The security protocol guarantees two properties. First, our proposal assures IoT users and services that they communicate with approved IoT gateways as endpoints, holding verified IoT devices that they need. Second, BorderChain also generates access tokens that the IoT service and users can use to query IoT resources legitimately inside the IoT domains. As a result, the protocol can convince IoT domain owners that the system will only authorize IoT requests that they approve. We realize our protocol in the form of a smart contract to allow many IoT entities such as IoT domain owners, IoT devices, IoT gateways, IoT vendors, IoT services, IoT users, and Internet Service Provider (ISP) to collaborate in a unified environment. We then implement entities in BorderChain as Node JS applications connecting to the Ethereum blockchain as our peer-to-peer platform. Based on our performance evaluation using several Raspberry Pi hardware and our private server, we show that BorderChain can process entities' authentication and authorization requests efficiently using all hardware resources. Finally, we release BorderChain for public use. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Nowadays, the safety of a mobile phone cannot be assured with the password of the owner. Humans generally do not remember passwords which can be simpler to recollect and additionally use the identical password across different applications. It becomes less-secured if an intruder gains access to that particular mobile and they can easily crack the OTP sent by the officials. In this paper, we proposed a new method of securing the OTP with the help of blockchain using tokens generated by Ethereum. In this approach, the application has an authentication model using an email and password, and another one is using the Ethereum account address. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2021.},

abstract={Electronic voting is the use of electronic means to cast and count votes. The system must be able to offer fairness, trust, transparency, privacy, integrity, and availability of votes. The application of block chain in electronic voting seems to match the above qualities of an electronic voting system. However, recent researches have shown that block chain technology lacks anonymity. Transactions are pseudonymous and not anonymous. For this cause, a proposed method to use linkable ring signatures in block chain electronic voting system provides anonymity. With this system, a voter can verify votes with the highest level of anonymity from other voters. Voters can also tally the votes without the use of centralized third party. The proposed system will be implemented using Ethereum protocol. It uses elliptic curve cryptography to provide authentication and non-repudiation, immutability of vote records through hashing algorithms, transparency, and accessibility due to its decentralized nature as well as voter anonymity. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2021.},

abstract={Digital identity plays the main role in the digital world. Thus, many researchers emphasize the determination of the accurate identity of users. This paper proposes the blockchain-based digital identity management system in Myanmar, to decrease the use of national identity document. The occurrence of duplicated identity numbers in Myanmar is the main issue, and another problem is how to recover the lost national identity card. Trusted humans and organizations that have the responsibility for the entire activity need secure data management. Blockchain technology built on the internet could use current identity data in a peer-to-peer, interoperable way to eliminate third parties. Using the benefit of blockchain, the unique and persistent identity number of the citizen will be stored in the blockchain network. The user could store encrypted private, personal, and sensitive data, as well as share verifications about the information on the blockchain. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2021.},

abstract={In every republic, the security of an election plays an irreversible impact on the outcome of the election results which determine the growth of the nation. The diversity of the electronic voting systems poses an enormous challenge in the credibility of the voting procedure. In addition, it has to minimize the cost of having a national election, while fulfilling and increasing the security conditions. The recently popularized blockchain technology assists in escalating the security issues, which may disrupt many traditional systems including the voting system. The immutability property and the decentralized architecture of the blockchain technology are exploited to make it an appropriate base for an e-voting application. Blockchaining voting scheme allows transparency, immutability and control of the voting ballot to the end user. This paper addresses the successful deployment of a usable and efficient e-voting system built on Ethereum Smart Contracts which provides a high level of transparency. Biometric Authentication is implemented to ensure that a voter is privileged to cast only his vote and eliminates masquerading. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2021.},

abstract={Secured data transmission and data sharing have always been a challenge on the Internet of things-based networks. Blockchain-enabled peer to peer (P2P) networks are suitable infrastructure for the Internet of Things (IoT) and Beyond 5G (B5G) applications. The advantage is that the distributed nature of architecture and security services provided by this network extends its use in all sort of financial transactions. There are many issues related to IoT based networks; Heterogeneous IoT devices, security, energy issues. This paper implements data security by employing private blockchain in SDN and public blockchain for peer to peer communication and a secured authentication method to validate the blocks in the network. To increase confidentiality and non-repudiation, it implements an additional component; here, the sender signs the particular operation while transferring the data from one user to another user. It is published with a public key and Public-key value-based signature generated with the private key of the transaction. Nodes authenticate this operation based on Public key value-based signature thus generated. The cryptography with hashing process provides better immutability. The results show enhanced security during data transmission and improved throughput, response time, reduction in end-to-end delay and overhead when compared to the existing methods. This work uses Pyethereum tester tool under the Ethereum platform. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={With the development of computing technology, the security and credibility of data is becoming more and more important. However, the security and trust of traditional centralized system is insufficient and data tampering is easy to occur, which leads to data distrustful. The characteristics of blockchain, such as traceable and tamper-proof, can solve the issue of data trust. However, the access threshold of the blockchain is high. In order to reduce the technical difficulty, in this article, a universal BaaS platform (called TrustedBaaS) which has high flexibility and scalability was designed based on consortium blockchain, it can support user-defined configuration according to requirements of users. Afterwards we described the process of executing a transaction in detail and discussed the core protocols and algorithms of the BaaS platform, which includes identity authentication, consensus algorithm, data protection protocol, smart contract and on-blockchain and off-blockchain data collaboration. Furthermore, we implemented TrustedBaaS based on Hyperledger Fabric and a vehicular information management application platform and a transaction settlement application platform were configured based on TrustedBaaS. Finally, we evaluated the performance of the TrustedBaaS and compared it with current public blockchain such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. The evaluation showed that the designed TrustedBaaS has better performance than the existing public blockchain platforms. Moreover, it is common distributed higher-level trusted platform which provides configurable and extensible functions and solves the problem that the access threshold of blockchain technology is high. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT), which uses the internet to connect users (devices) from various fields, has become widely popular nowadays. It is predicted that IoT will play an increasingly important role and be deployed in people ' s daily life. However, there are still various security issues to be addressed in IoT, such as decentralized authentication, low power device and lightweight cryptographic framework, privacy problems, and so on. Blockchain technology, with the characteristics of decentralization, permissionless, transparency, and immutable, has received great attention. To address these security risks, especially the decentralized authentication problem of IoT, and improve the credibility of the authentication, this paper presents a Blockchain-Based Secure Framework (BBSF) for IoT applications. With a smart contract, BBSF supports certificate issuance, update, revocation, and audit functions. We also conduct security analysis and show that the proposed BBSF provides confidentiality, availability, data integrity, and so on. In addition, We deploy BBSF with Ethereum to verify the system stability, scalability, and efficiency. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={Modern Internet TCP uses Secure Sockets Layers (SSL)/Transport Layer Security (TLS) for secure communication, which relies on Public Key Infrastructure (PKIs) to authenticate public keys. Conventional PKI is done by Certification Authorities (CAs), issuing and storing Digital Certificates, which are public keys of users with the users identity. This leads to centralization of authority with the CAs and the storage of CAs being vulnerable and imposes a security concern. There have been instances in the past where CAs have issued rogue certificates or the CAs have been hacked to issue malicious certificates. Motivated from these facts, in this paper, we propose a method (named as Trustful), which aims to build a decentralized PKI using blockchain. Blockchains provide immutable storage in a decentralized manner and allows us to write smart contracts. Ethereum blockchain can be used to build a web of trust model where users can publish attributes, validate attributes about other users by signing them and creating a trust store of users that they trust. Trustful works on the Web-of-Trust (WoT) model and allows for any entity on the network to verify attributes about any other entity through a trusted network. This provides an alternative to the conventional CA-based identity verification model. The proposed model has been implemented and tested for efficacy and known major security attacks. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={In the traditional image copyright protection system, watermarking technology is considered as an important technology to overcome the data protection problem and verify the data ownership relationship. However, the existing watermarking technology often needs a trusted third party to arbitrate in the implementation process, which may be difficult to find or costly. Meanwhile, the common image watermarking algorithm needs to operate the image data, which will inevitably lead to the image data loss. With the development of blockchain technology, the functions of de-trusted third parties and the fair and automatic processing characteristics of smart contracts attached to it have entered the public view. In this paper, we study the function of the zero-watermarking algorithm in image protection and its complete storage and authentication scheme, then propose a secure blockchain-based image copyright protection framework and build a system according to this framework. This framework combines blockchain and zero-watermark technology and uses interplanetary file system to solve the blockchain data expansion problem. Besides, the image owner can authenticate the image and realize the copyright traceability of the image. Furthermore, the keyword search function of the stored images in the system is realized based on a smart contract, which solves the problem of lack of trusted third parties. Experiment illustrates that the proposed scheme is feasible. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={There has been wide range of applications involving smart home systems for user comfort and accessibility to essential commodities. Users enjoy featured home services supported by the IoT smart devices. These IoT devices are resource-constrained, incapable of securing themselves and can be easily hacked. Edge computing can provide localized computations and storage which can augment such capacity limitations for IoT devices. Furthermore, blockchain has emerged as technology with capabilities to provide secure access and authentication for IoT devices in decentralized manner. In this paper, we propose an authentication scheme which integrate attribute based access control using smart contracts with ERC-20 Token (Ethereum Request For Comments) and edge computing to construct a secure framework for IoT devices in Smart home system. The edge server provide scalability to the system by offloading heavier computation tasks to edge servers. We present system architecture and design and discuss various aspects related to testing and implementation of the smart contracts. We show that our proposed scheme is secure by thoroughly analysing its security goals with respect to confidentiality, integrity and availability. Finally, we conduct a performance evaluation to demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed scheme. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={With the rapid growth of blockchain, more and more people possess cryptocurrencies or use decentralized applications (Dapp). A wallet in blockchain not only stores your assets but also represents your online identity. Nowadays, document notary using blockchain is getting mature to prevent the problem of the counterfeit certificate. In this paper, we integrate a cellphone-based wallet with a novel visional certificate verification system. By the trusted execution environment (TEE) protection, a user can isolate his/her private key without the leakage attack. Two-factor authentication is required to generate a signature. Different from existing platforms, our system adopts IPFS, a P2P network for storing and sharing data, for storing the certificate image, which offers the function of visional verification for better persuasiveness. Furthermore, the unique time-limited verification can restrict the accessing period of the verifier for better privacy protection. As a result, our verification system provides several promising features to enhance security and privacy strength. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={The utility of virtual circuit (VC) based devices - UAVs, Drones, and similar other IoT based devices have gained immense momentum in the present day and age. These devices are predominantly used for aerial surveying in sensitive and remote areas. It is alarming that issues pertaining to stalking and information control have increased with the growth of technology. This paper presents a Blockchain Technology (BCT) based solution to improve the security and privacy of VC based device data. The proposed design is evaluated by implementing an IoT based application in a virtual vehicle monitoring system. The technical information about the instructions to the vehicle (devices), authentication, integrity, and vehicle reactions are stored in a cloud platform wherein Pentatope based Elliptic curve cryptography and SHA are used to ensure privacy in data storage. The data is later stored in an Ethereum based public blockchain to enable seamless BCT transactions. This system uses the Ganache platform for BCT that ensures data protection and privacy. Furthermore, metamask wallet for Ethbalance is required to perform transactions over BCT. The proposed methodology thus helps to protect data from stalkers, plaintext attacks as well as ciphertext attacks. The results, when compared with the state-of-the-art, justify the efficiency and security aspects of the proposed approach. © 2020},

abstract={With the advancement of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and the proliferation of sensor technologies, the Internet of Things (IoT) is now being widely used in smart home for the purposes of efficient resource management and pervasive sensing. In smart homes, various IoT devices are connected to each other, and these connections are centered on gateways. The role of gateways in the smart homes is significant, however, its centralized structure presents multiple security vulnerabilities such as integrity, certification, and availability. To address these security vulnerabilities, in this paper, we propose a blockchain-based smart home gateway network that counters possible attacks on the gateway of smart homes. The network consists of three layers including device, gateway, and cloud layers. The blockchain technology is employed at the gateway layer wherein data is stored and exchanged in the form blocks of blockchain to support decentralization and overcome the problem from traditional centralized architecture. The blockchain ensures the integrity of the data inside and outside of the smart home and provides availability through authentication and efficient communication between network members. We implemented the proposed network on the Ethereum blockchain technology and evaluated in terms of standard security measures including security response time and accuracy. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed security solutions outperforms over the existing solutions. © 2020, The Author(s).},

abstract={One of the backbone technology of Blockchains is cryptography. In simpler terms cryptography is the mathematical art of secret writing, however it's applications are not limited to writing secret codes only. Essentially cryptography is used to achieve three main security goals namely confidentiality (in-formation must be hidden from the unintended users), integrity (information must be prevented from illicit modifications) and availability (information must be readily available to intended users at all times). In cryptography confidentiality is achieved by employing a technique called as Encryption, integrity is achieved by employing special one way functions called as Cryptographic Hash Functions and authentication (process for verifying identity of the sender) is achieved by employing a technique called as Digital Signatures. For better understanding about the working of Blockchain it is essential to understand cryptographic concepts on which Blockchain is built. This paper presents the brief overview of such cryptographic concepts. In particular this papers throws light on the cryptographic concepts used to build Bitcoin and Ethereum Blockchains. Furthermore this paper also throws light on the need and requirements of post-quantum cryptographic primitives for post-quantum Blockchains. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={Biometric authentication is the preferred authentication scheme in modern computing systems. While it offers enhanced usability, it also requires cautious handling of sensitive users' biometric templates. In this paper, a distributed scheme that eliminates the requirement for a central node that holds users' biometric templates is presented. This is replaced by an Ethereum/IPFS combination to which the templates of the users are stored in a homomorphically encrypted form. The scheme enables the biometric authentication of the users by any third party service, while the actual biometric templates of the user never leave his device in non encrypted form. Secure authentication of users in enabled, while sensitive biometric data are not exposed to anyone. Experiments show that the scheme can be applied as an authentication mechanism with minimal time overhead. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={Private blockchain networks are used by enterprises to manage decentralized processes without trusted mediators and without exposing their assets publicly on an open network like Ethereum. Yet external parties that cannot join such networks may have a compelling need to be informed about certain data items on their shared ledgers along with certifications of data authenticity; e.g., a mortgage bank may need to know about the sale of a mortgaged property from a network managing property deeds. These parties are willing to compensate the networks in exchange for privately sharing information with proof of authenticity and authorization for external use. We have devised a novel and cryptographically secure protocol to effect a fair exchange between rational network members and information recipients using a public blockchain and atomic swap techniques. Using our protocol, any member of a private blockchain can atomically reveal private blockchain data with proofs in exchange for a monetary reward to an external party if and only if the external party is a valid recipient. The protocol preserves confidentiality of data for the recipient, and in addition, allows it to mount a challenge if the data turns out to be inauthentic. We also formally analyze the security and privacy of this protocol, which can be used in a wide array of practical scenarios. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={In information security, access control is the selective restriction of access to an online resource or service. One of the most used access control models is Attributebased Access Control, in which access rights are granted to users by evaluating suitable attributes (user attributes, resource attributes, and environment conditions). An important aspect of access control is to guarantee that the identity of the user accessing a service is preserved. In this paper, we deal with this problem and propose a new solution based on a blockchain to ensure that only authorized users can access a service, yet preserving anonymity and unlinkability of their accesses. Moreover, the cooperation among several trusted parties allows the identification of the user accessing a service in case of need. © 2020 J. Adv. Inf. Technol.},

abstract={With the recent rise of cryptocurrencies' popularity, the security and management of crypto-tokens have become critical. We have witnessed many attacks on users and providers, which have resulted in significant financial losses. To remedy these issues, several wallet solutions have been proposed. However, these solutions often lack either essential security features, usability, or do not allow users to customize their spending rules. In this paper, we propose SmartOTPs, a smart-contract wallet framework that gives a flexible, usable, and secure way of managing crypto-tokens in a self-sovereign fashion. The proposed framework consists of four components (i.e., an authenticator, a client, a hardware wallet, and a smart contract), and it provides 2-factor authentication (2FA) performed in two stages of interaction with the blockchain. To the best of our knowledge, our framework is the first one that utilizes one-time passwords (OTPs) in the setting of the public blockchain. In SmartOTPs, the OTPs are aggregated by a Merkle tree and hash chains whereby for each authentication only a short OTP (e.g., 16B-long) is transferred from the authenticator to the client. Such a novel setting enables us to make a fully air-gapped authenticator by utilizing small QR codes or a few mnemonic words, while additionally offering resilience against quantum cryptanalysis. We have made a proof-of-concept based on the Ethereum platform. Our cost analysis shows that the average cost of a transfer operation is comparable to existing 2FA solutions using smart contracts with multi-signatures. © 2020 ACM.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) technologies are transforming traditional businesses into digital-based platforms allowing for more service innovation, performance efficiency and customer satisfaction. Novel services enable users to utilize their personal devices (eg. mobile phones or laptops) to access the IoT platform, process data, and control the IoT infrastructure. However, these services impose critical user authentication and access control requirements. In this paper, we propose a decentralized user authentication and access control system for the IoT platforms via a permissioned blockchain network. We define an authorization sensitivity factor to provide clients with specific access control privileges and we consider an ehealth system as a use case example to demonstrate our solution. The proposed system is implemented using Ethereum platform. Besides, we investigate a threat model that considers an insider Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. The proposed defense mechanism utilizes a modifier function in the smart contract and keeps a real-time record of legitimate users to restrict function calls. The results illustrate the benefits of the defense mechanism in terms of the system response time. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={E-voting is an application of in the election process. E-voting was developed to make the election process easier, safer and more practical. Blockchain technology is explained as a safe technology because of its distributed nature. Tso et al's e-voting is one of the e-voting mechanism that uses the ethereum smart contract blockchain. Tso et al e-voting application use asymmetric cryptography for the safety of its users in the form of Paillier's algorithm. This study proposed use of the AES-256 algorithm to secure key data on smart cards for e-voting process, SHA-256 for authentication, and secure communication protocols to secure the key in sending process. The key is stored in a ciphertext format with AES-256 encryption and SHA-256 as authentication algorithm. The results of implementing smart card prototypes as key storage in the Tso et al e-voting application shows that the proposed e-voting scheme has a key storage time of 0.774 seconds, a memory capacity of 572 bytes, with 0.472 seconds generation speed. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={Managing identity across an ever-growing digital services landscape has become one of the most challenging tasks for security experts. Over the years, several Identity Management (IDM) systems were introduced and adopted to tackle with the growing demand of an identity. In this series, a recently emerging IDM system is Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) which offers greater control and access to users regarding their identity. This distinctive feature of the SSI IDM system represents a major development towards the availability of sovereign identity to users. uPort is an emerging open-source identity management system providing sovereign identity to users, organisations, and other entities. As an emerging identity management system, it requires meticulous analysis of its architecture, working, operational services, efficiency, advantages and limitations. Therefore, this paper contributes towards achieving all of these objectives. Firstly, it presents the architecture and working of the uPort identity management system. Secondly, it develops a Decentralized Application (DApp) to demonstrate and evaluate its operational services and efficiency. Finally, based on the developed DApp and experimental analysis, it presents the advantages and limitations of the uPort identity management system. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={The outbreak of the respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus (COVID-19) has caused the world to face an existential health crisis. To contain the infectious disease, many countries have quarantined their citizens for several weeks to months and even suspended most economic activities. To track the movements of residents, the governments of many states have adopted various novel technologies. Connecting billions of sensors and devices over the Internet, the so-called Internet of Things (IoT), has been used for outbreak control. However, these technologies also pose serious privacy risks and security concerns with regards to data transmission and storage. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based system to provide the secure management of home quarantine. The privacy and security attributes for various events are based on advanced cryptographic primitives. To demonstrate the application of the system, we provide a case study in an IoT system with a desktop computer, laptop, Raspberry Pi single-board computer, and the Ethereum smart contract platform. The obtained results prove its ability to satisfy security, efficiency, and low-cost requirements. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Fog computing is an emerging computing paradigm which expands cloud-based computing services near the network edge. With this new computing paradigm, new challenges arise in terms of security and privacy. These concerns are due to the distributed ownership of Fog devices. Because of the large scale distributed nature of devices at the Fog layer, secure authentication for communication among these devices is a major challenge. The traditional authentication methods (password-based, certificate-based and biometric-based) are not directly applicable due to the unique architecture and characteristics of the Fog. Moreover, the traditional authentication methods consume significantly more computation power and incur high latency, and this does not meet the key requirements of the Fog. To fill this gap, this article proposes a secure decentralised location-based device to device (D2D) authentication model in which Fog devices can mutually authenticate each other at the Fog layer by using Blockchain. We considered an Ethereum Blockchain platform for the Fog device registration, authentication, attestation and data storage. We presented the overall system architecture, various participants and their transactions and message interaction between the participants. We validated the proposed model by comparing it with the existing method; results showed that the proposed authentication mechanism was efficient and secure. From the performance evaluation, it was found that the proposed method is computationally efficient and secure in a highly distributed Fog network. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Energy trading in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), a fundamental approach to realize Industry 4.0, plays a vital role in satisfying energy demands and optimizing system efficiency. Existing research works utilize a utility company to distribute energy to energy nodes with the help of energy brokers. Afterwards, they apply blockchain to provide transparency, immutability, and auditability of peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading. However, their schemes are constructed on a weak security model and do not consider the cheating attack initiated by energy sellers. Such an attack refers to an energy seller refusing to transfer the negotiated energy to an energy purchaser who already paid money. In this article, we propose FeneChain, a blockchain-based energy trading scheme to supervise and manage the energy trading process toward building a secure energy trading system and improving energy quality for Industry 4.0. Specifically, we leverage anonymous authentication to protect user privacy, and we design a timed-commitments-based mechanism to guarantee the verifiable fairness during energy trading. Moreover, we utilize fine-grained access control for energy trading services. We also build a consortium blockchain among energy brokers to verify and record energy trading transactions. Finally, we formally analyze the security and privacy of FeneChain and evaluate its performance (i.e., computational costs and communication overhead) by implementing a prototype via a local Ethereum test network and Raspberry Pi. © 2005-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={A fair contract signing scheme ensures that contract signing participants can fairly exchange the digital signatures of the contract, which has a wide range of applications on the Internet. Verifiable Encrypted Signature (VES) can be used as a fair exchange mechanism for digital signatures, in which it requires a centralized Trusted Third Party (TTP) as an adjudicator. However, there are many security challenges with the centralized TTP. For example, it may disclose the contents of the contract, collude with others, or even occurs a service interruption. To address those problems, in this paper, we propose a two-party fair contract signing scheme based on Ethereum smart contract, which allows participants to fairly perform the contract signing procedures on the blockchain. Specifically, we propose a modified VES scheme in which no centralized adjudicator is needed. Then we design the fair contract signing scheme based on the modified VES scheme. We leverage the Ethereum smart contract technology to ensure fairness, which has the characteristics of decentralization, verifiability, autonomy, efficiency, and tampering resistant. The theoretical analysis and experimental results show that our scheme is secure and feasible. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Email services nowadays are flooded by spam and phishing attacks. Email service providers build their own email filters to protect the final users from such attacks resulting in an overall better experience. However, the attacks come mainly from the same problem in the email protocols, i.e., the lack of authentication mechanism. In this work, we attempt to minimize some of the most common problems identified in email services such as spam, phishing, spoofing, lack of encryption, repudiation and centralization by implementing a smart contract over the Ethereum protocol. The proposal involves a decentralized system, a smart contract, a file system and two applications used as proof of concept. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={Ethereum is a public, open-source, decentralized, and peer-to-peer blockchain-based computing network which is involving to the usefulness of smart contract. It gives a distributed Turing-complete virtual machine in which some codes can be executed by utilizing a worldwide and public network of nodes. The compelled certificate creation and Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attacks are two major attacks on End-to-End Encryption (EEE) and SSL/TLS. A portion of the real attacks on end-to-end encryption and SSL/TLS is IP/ARP poisoning and the phishing attack. MITM attack makes the client difficult to understand, whether they are associated with a unique verified and secured connection or not. Since the certificate and public-key that is being passed during the connection setup is unreliable and insecure, the attacker can undoubtedly change the data in the certificate and leaves the endorsement of the certificate and public-key to the client. The purpose of this paper is to present a solution of providing the legitimacy and authenticity of freely shared and published online digital data, e.g., digital certificates, cryptographic keys, and common reference strings such as shared passwords using a mix of recently developed innovations which primary include blockchain, smart contract, InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), and quantum-resistant Password-based Authenticated Key Exchange (PAKE) protocol over rings and ideal lattices. Ethereum smart contract is utilized to manage, surveil, and give detectability and visibility into the history of digital data from its beginning to the most recent variant, in a way that it is decentralized and internationally accessed with high integrity, resiliency, and transparency, that we should thank to the immutability and irreversibility of the blockchain. The full code of our smart contract is given, with a discourse on the execution and testing of its key functionalities. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={LoRaWAN, part of the long range Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, is a Low Power Wide Area (LPWA) protocol that enables communication between the battery operated resource constrained devices. Although LoRaWAN provides system-level security, these networks are based on a basic assumption of trust between the network server and the user, which as a result empowers a network server with undue authorities. Moreover, the nature of the LoRaWAN join procedure, which is a key component for ensuring network operation, is highly susceptible to jamming and replay attacks through slight packet manipulation, thus making the network vulnerable. In order to address these deficiencies, we present a blockchain-based distributed framework for the LoRaWAN join procedure, in order to provide a secure and trusted authentication system within LoRaWAN networks. Our proposed solution eliminates the jamming and replay attack threats against the LoRaWAN join procedure and in addition builds trust among LoRa end devices and network servers. The framework is endorsed by a Proof of Concept (PoC) implementation using the Ethereum blockchain which is used to evaluate the proposed system in realistic LoRaWAN network scenarios. The simulations results indicate that the proposed solution achieves efficient system performance up to an upper bound on the load level which involves 30 join requests from 1000 concurrent clients. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={As supply chain attacks such as forged certificates and modified software updates to smart grid remain a major challenge, blockchain has emerged as an attractive solution for enabling supply chain security due to its transparent, immutability, and decentralisation characteristics. These attacks, which focus on compromising smart grid components and services, can have a cascading effect on smart grid operations. A large number of interdependencies between the components and services and reliance on trusted third parties hinders the ability to safely and securely identify and authenticate the components and services. We propose Idenx, a blockchain-based identity management system for mitigating supply chain attacks. Idenx uses the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) to construct the identity of every component or service and further uses a Secure Pseudo-Random Function (PRF) with the identity to derive an attribute identifier for the component or service. Our approach for identifying and authenticating a component is based on Idenx smart contracts that facilitate supply chain security agreements without trusted third parties. We presented the security analysis of Idenx and the results show that it is resilient to supply chain attacks. Furthermore, we implemented a prototype of Idenx on Ethereum blockchain and evaluated it with respect to two real-world smart grid supply chain attacks. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={Current online services rely blindly on authentication providers to perform identity management and authentication. User credentials in these authentication providers are susceptible to large-scale account hacking. Distributed Ledger Teachnology (DLT) in general and blockchain can offer a solution by decentralizing ownership of credentials and a protocol for verifying one's record in an immutable chain of data. Blockchain can create a secure platform for online service providers to authenticate users with no single point of failure and decrease the possibility of attacks and user data leakages via backdoors. The purpose of this research is to analyze the limitations of centralized authentication system and propose a blockchain-based authentication solution to overcome the issues. In this paper we propose a robust, transparent and secure blockchain-based authentication mechanism called AuthChain. The implementation and testing of the proposed web and android native application was successfully completed with a prototype implementation on single node Ethereum Blockchain. © 2020 Polish Psychological Bulletin.

abstract={Network resource management relies on trusted infrastructures. However, current trusted infrastructures have centralized or hierarchical structures where root nodes often have privileges over subtrees. Hacked or malicious roots may affect subtrees by modifying IP ownership, routing and so on. Therefore, a trusted and decentralized network resource management becomes crucial. The emergence of blockchain such as Ethereum becomes a leading candidate for achieving trusted and decentralized network resource management. In this paper, based on Ethereum, we design a trusted authentication scheme that includes voting policy, endorsement, credibility model and rebinding mechanism to ensure the credibility of entities. Our scheme can allocate, delegate and transfer network resources in a trusted and decentralized style. The experimental results verify the feasibility and security of our scheme. When an entity is hacked or malicious, its endorsement authentication is revoked and the entity does not have the right to manage the network resources. In addition, the overhead increased by the trusted authentication scheme is within a reasonable range. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={Cyber-physical Systems (CPS) are reshaping the way of interaction with the physical world. Moreover, the true potential of CPS will be realized when a decentralized approach will be taken into account. Blockchain is an up-and-coming technology which can establish trust in CPS, where participants do not trust each other. Blockchain applications eliminate the middle man to provide trust and making the processes more efficient cheaper. It's decentralized nature and cryptographic algorithm make it immune to attack and becomes a secure technology. When the data is stored on the blockchain it becomes immutable, ensuring trust in data. Nevertheless, this does not guarantee the trustworthiness of the device which is generating the data. We propose a blockchain-based signature storage solution to ensure trust among the participants which is further applicable to a diverse range of blockchain-based CPS applications. We have implemented our system using the Ethereum network and Docker Tools. Our proposed solution guarantees security properties i.e. device identification, authentication, integrity, and non-repudiation. Also, it reduces the storage space and storage cost than the traditional usage of blockchain in CPS. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={Ethereum is a blockchain-based distributed network and has been a successful platform to host decentralized applications. On the other hand, fog computing has emerged as one of the most demanding field for research as it brings the services of cloud to the edge of the network, i.e. closer to the IoT devices. To satisfy the QoS requirement of latency sensitive applications, the concept of fog computing is introduced in order to implement the idea of smart home, city etc. Though the fog nodes can support latency sensitive applications, but their computational capacity is low which leads to more vulnerability against known attacks. But Ethereum has paved the way to develop smart contracts to implement any logic written in it upon calling. The usage of smart contracts in securing the fog node can be effective as it runs in a blockchain enabled network which makes the smart contract immutable and secured against modification. This creates a scope of using smart contract's logic to ensure the security of fog nodes and IoT devices which they earnestly require. This also eliminates the necessity of public-private key pair and other authentication systems used in fog-cloud architecture. In our work, we modified the conventional fog-cloud architecture by introducing blockchain-based fog layer to ensure better security and privacy for both fog layer and IoT devices. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={Biometrics, with its uniqueness to every individual, has been adapted as a security authentication feature by many institutions. These biometric data are processed into templates that are saved on databases, and a central authority centralizes and controls these databases. This form of storing biometric data, or in our case fingerprint template, is asymmetric and prone to three main security attacks, such as fake template input, template modification or deletion, and channel interception by a malicious attacker. In this paper, we secure an encrypted fingerprint template by a symmetric peer-to-peer network and symmetric encryption. The fingerprint is encrypted by the symmetric key algorithm: Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm and then is uploaded to a symmetrically distributed storage system, the InterPlanetary File system (IPFS). The hash of the templated is stored in a decentralized blockchain. The slow transaction speed of the blockchain has limited its use in real-life applications, such as large file storage, hence, the merge with IPFS to store just the hashes of large files. The encrypted template is uploaded to the IPFS, and its returned digest is stored on the Ethereum network. The implementation of IPFS prevents storing the raw state of the fingerprint template on the Ethereum network in order to reduce cost and also prevent identity theft. This procedure is an improvement of previous systems. By adopting the method of template hashing, the proposed system is cost-effective and efficient. The experimental results depict that the proposed system secures the fingerprint template by encryption, hashing, and decentralization. © 2020 by the authors.},

abstract={The security of the Internet of things(IoT) has become a very critical and sensitive issue. In the limited network based on COAP, due to the limited ability of nodes and the lack of reliable authentication and access control mechanism in the Resource Directory (RD), devices are easy to be attacked and cause data leakage. This paper proposes a method to enhance the security of COAP nodes by using blockchain. By extending the business capability of the CoAP RD, the semantics of the security attributes are added; and a security service access agent is defined to be responsible for the blockchain operation; the RD can be involved in the authentication/access control of the blockchain when the CoAP node resource access is parsed. The CoAP node can transfer the device and service data to the blockchain for secure storage. In this paper, the Californium COAP framework and Ethereum are used as the verification platform to realize the software and security service access agent software that extend the RD security semantics. The authentication / access control is carried out in combination with the blockchain, and the COAP node provides the security storage capacity in combination with the blockchain. The work of this paper shows that it is feasible to use blockchain technology to improve the security capability of COAP nodes in the IoT. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={Personal privacy disclosure is one of the most serious challenges in smart industrial applications. Anonymous authentication is an effective solution to protect personal privacy. However, the existing anonymous credential protocols are not perfectly suitablefor smart industrial environments such as smart vehicles in the sense that the credential revocation issue is not well-solved. In this article, we propose a Blockchain-based Anonymous authentication with Selective revocation for Smart industrial applications (BASS) for smart industrial applications supporting attribute privacy, selective revocation, credential soundness, and multishowing-unlinkability. Specifically, an efficient selective revocation mechanism is proposed based on dynamic accumulators and the signature algorithm due to Pointcheval and Sanders as the overlay of the BASS. According to the diverse demands of credential authorities, BASS can selectively provide revocation of credentials or revocation of users. We extend BASS from single-attribute privacy to multiattribute privacy as well. Finally, we implement a prototype to evaluate the cryptographic core primitives of BASS by deploying smart contracts in Ethereum to demonstrate the validity of BASS in smart industrial applications. © 2005-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={The Internet of Things is constantly capturing interest from modern applications, changing our everyday life and empowering industrial applications. Interaction and the collaboration among smart devices offer new challenges to security since they conflict with economic and energy consumption requirement constraints. On the other hand, the lack of security measures could negatively impact the concrete adoption of this paradigm. This paper focuses on the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol, widely adopted in the Internet of Things. This protocol does not implement natively secure authentication mechanisms, which are demanded to developers. Hence, this paper proposes a novel OTP (one-time password)-authentication schema for MQTT, which uses the Ethereum blockchain to implement a second-factor out-of-band channel. The proposal enables the authentication of both local and remote devices preserving user privacy and guaranteeing trust and accountability via Ethereum smart contracts. © 2020 by the authors.

abstract={Blockchain technology has gained considerable attention for different types of stakeholders due to its stable implementation in the field of digital currency like Bitcoin. Some users use Bitcoin for payment exchanges against any business while others use the Bitcoin network for earning Bitcoins itself, and there is also another type of user who called hackers those flood different types of attacks to illegally earn some Bitcoins or collapsing overall network. There are also numerous uses of blockchain technology, e.g. health, automation industry, energy sector, security and authentication in smart grids. In this study, we have elaborated on different critical aspects of Blockchain technology like its style of working mechanism, possible improvement suggestions by using Proof-of-Stake, and other custom variations, attempting seven types of challenges by different novel techniques. Moreover, we have also explained the current state-of-the-artwork in blockchain's non-financial applications like Healthcare in which contribution of four-layered custom blockchain models related to precision medicine and the clinical trial was notable. Moreover, a mobile app model called HDG for the automation of medical records without compromising privacy was also a prominent contribution. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={IoT Devices have revolutionized how people interact with each other and their surroundings, with Gartner predicting 50 billion devices by 2020. IoT devices emerging from WSN to RFIDs are capable of sensing, actuating and sharing data but are resource-constrained devices meaning these devices have limited memory, storage, and computation power. Thus, IoT devices are incapable of securing themselves from various security and privacy threats. Moreover, current Cloud-IoT architectures are centralized; managed and controlled by Trusted Third parties also individuals have no control over their data. Fog-IoT integration has better latency, response time and is much secure compared to Cloud-IoT integration. Recently, Blockchain emerged as a decentralized, highly trusted and tamper-proof technology. In this paper, we proposed a blockchain-based scheme for secure User authentication access to Fog enabled IoT devices. The proposed scheme utilizes the Ethereum Smart Contract. We developed our smart contract using Solidity language with Remix-IDE and tested its functionalities on two test networks Test RPC (Ganache) and Rinkeby Test Network. We also analyzed security vulnerabilities of our smart contract on the ChainSecurity analyzing tool. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={Recently, with the increase of smart factories, smart cities, and the 4th industrial revolution, internal user authentication is emerging as an important issue. The existing user authentication and Access Control architecture can use the centralized system to forge access history by the service manager, which can cause problems such as evasion of responsibility and internal corruption. In addition, the user must independently manage the ID or physical authentication medium for authentication of each service, it is difficult to manage the subscribed services. This paper proposes a Hybrid blockchain-based integrated ID model to solve the above problems. The user creates authentication information based on the electronic signature of the Ethereum Account, a public blockchain, and provides authentication to a service provider composed of a Hyperledger Fabric, a private blockchain. The service provider ensures the integrity of the information by recording the Access History and authentication information in the Internal-Ledger. Through the proposed architecture, we can integrate the physical pass or application for user authentication and authorization into one Unification ID. Service providers can prevent non-Repudiation of responsibility by recording their authority and access history in ledger. © 2020 Global IT Research Institute - GIRI.},

abstract={Blockchain has been used primarily in cryptocurrency applications like Bitcoin and Ethereum. These use cases show the staying power of blockchain technology and suggest additional uses such as smart contracting. We suggest these use cases, while producing knowledge, do not forecast the future of blockchain. Learning-by-doing reveals the evolution of blockchain as a sociotechnical system, suggesting that there is more to learn. Predicting how sociotechnical systems will evolve is difficult, but historical and lexical analyses suggest two areas for blockchain growth. One is provenance, authentication through recording of ownership or other control state, applicable to jewels, real property, art works, food stuffs, designer items, and anything else where genuineness is valued. The other is chain-of-custody, proving that duty of care has been faithfully executed regarding living beings (children, people in legal custody, research subjects, research animals, pets), or that inanimate things (evidence, data, representations such as photographs) have not been tampered with. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The importance and usage of the distributed cloud is increasing rapidly over a traditionally centralized cloud for the storing and exchanging of digital assets between untrusted parties in many business sectors. Storing the digital assets in the distributed cloud is considered superior to traditional cloud computing in terms of environmentally friendly, cost, security and other technical dimensions. In this article, a contemporary architecture DistProv is proposed where an open source distributed cloud IPFS is used to store and transfer the digital assets between the consignor and consignee. These two are untrusted parties exchanging sensitive documents secured by cryptographic algorithms with permission-based access verified by ethereum smart contracts using zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) and simultaneously publishing the provenance data about the digital asset as a transaction on the blockchain. This article also discusses on verifying the integrity of the digital assets and authentication of the consignor and thus preserving a strong CIA triad. © 2020 by IGI Global. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Classified protection is one of primary security policies of information system in many countries. With the increasing popularity of blockchain in various fields of applications, it is extremely necessary to promote classified protection for blockchain’s risk assessment in order to push forward the sustainable development of blockchain. Taking the Level 3 in Chinese classified protection 2.0 as an example, this paper proposes the common evaluation rules on blockchain to ensure that blockchain can meet the needs of countries to build it as critical infrastructure. Both assessment requirements and enforcement proposals are presented and analyzed from the standpoint of blockchain’s core technologies, e.g., peer-to-peer network, distributed ledger, contract’s scripting system, and consensus mechanism. Moreover, the assessment results on three main platforms, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Hyperledger, are summarized and analyzed in compliance with the control points specified in the level 3. Our investigation indicates that the current blockchain is able to satisfy the requirements of evaluation items in many aspects, such as software fault tolerance, resource control, backup and recovery, but further improvements are still needed for some aspects, including security audit, access control, identification and authentication, data integrity, etc., in order to satisfy the requirements of important fields on national security, economic development and human life. © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

abstract={Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks have caused significant disruptions in the operations of Internet-based services. These DDoS attacks use large scale botnets, which often exploit millions of compromised Internet of Things (IoT) devices worldwide. IoT devices are traditionally less secure and are easy to be exploited. The extent of these exploitations has increased after the publication of the Mirai botnet source code on GitHub that provided a foundation for the attackers to develop and launch Mirai botnet variants. The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) proposed RFC 8520 Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD) so that an IoT device can convey to the network the level of network access it requires to accomplish its standard functionality. Though MUD is a promising effort, there is a need to evaluate its effectiveness, identify its limitations, and enhance its architecture to overcome its weakness and improve its effficiency. The latest Mirai variant malware is exploiting vulnerabilities of Internet of Things devices. As MUD does not consider identifying and patching vulnerabilities present in the device before the issuance of the MUD profile, a device can be compromised even in the presence of the Manufacturer Usage Description profile by exploiting either the configuration vulnerabilities or firmware vulnerabilities present in the device. This paper presents an evaluation study of the Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD), identifies its weaknesses, and proposed enhancements in its architecture. This research proposed a mechanism for identifying and eliminating the configuration vulnerabilities before creating the MUD profile for a device to minimize the attack surface. This research adopts the OWASP firmware testing methodology for discovering vulnerabilities in the firmware of WiFi home routers. The device is allowed to request the MUD profile only if the identified firmware vulnerabilities are low. The identified firmware vulnerabilities are patched in case the score of the identified firmware vulnerabilities is moderate or high. The device is allowed to request the MUD profile after the vulnerabilities are patched. The firmware vulnerabilities are shared with other peers using blockchain smart contracts. There is a possibility that the MUD URL might be pointing to a corrupted or malicious MUD profile hosted at the attacker file server due to the absence of an authentication mechanism in theMUDprocess. This research also proposed an authentication mechanism for device MUD profile, MUD file generator, and MUD file server. Implementation results show that proposed enhancements improve the security services provided by the Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD). © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

abstract={Authentication is a method for securing an account by verifying the user identity by inputting email with a password. Two factor authentications is an authentication system that combines the first-factor authentication with the second factor. General two factor authentication by entering an email or username with a password are similar. However, two factor authentication requires additional information that must be inputted by the user. Additional information can be in the form of tokens or one-time passwords (OTP). Two factor authentications generally still uses third-party services to generate token or OTP still have vulnerable because can attacked from tokens steal through MITM and found that the generated tokens with the same value. Therefore, we propose a two-factor authentication framework based on ethereum blockchain with dApp as token generation system. Firstly, outcome from the analysis of the system, next succeeded in creating a two-factor authentication system without using third-parties. Second, token system generate up to 3164 different tokens in one second and has been collisions tested. Third, security method to protect token from MITM attack. The attacker unable to get access caused all the checking are done by dApp user authentication. © 2020, Universitas Pesantren Tinggi Darul Ulum. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Academic credentials are precious assets as they form an evidence for one’s identity and eligibility. Fraud in issuance and verification of academic certificates have been a long-standing issue in academic community. Due to lack of anti- forgery mechanisms there has been substantial increase in fraudulent certificates. The need of the hour is to have a transparent and reliable model for issuing and verifying academic certificates to eliminate fraud in the process. Decentralized, Auditable and Tamper-proof properties of Blockchain makes it possibly the best choice for issuing and verifying academic certificates. In this paper we propose a model, where regulatory body authorizes higher education Institutes (universities and colleges) for issuing academic certificates to students in a decentralized way. Anyone in the world can verify the authenticity of the certificate by triggering appropriate smart contract functions, thus eliminating any possibility of fraud in the process. In addition we used multi signature scheme where certificates are required to be signed by designated authority from Higher Education Institutes, thus allowing for multi-level checks on certificate contents before being successfully deployed on Blockchain. We have also provide Proof of Concept in Ethereum Blockchain and evaluated its performance in terms of cost, security and scalability. © 2020 SCPE.},

abstract={Multi-party authorization (MPA) typically involves multiple parties to control and grant access to shared data. MPA is used to solve the insider’s attack problem by ensuring that a single authority or party is not acting alone. Currently, almost all existing implementations of MPA are centralized and fall short in providing logs and events related to provenance of granting permissions in a trusted, secure, immutable, auditable, and decentralized manner. Moreover, for sharing data, proxy re-encryption algorithms are often used to give secure access to encrypted shared data. These schemes and algorithms are also centralized and cannot be trusted. In this paper, we propose a fully decentralized blockchain-based solution in which MPA is implemented using Ethereum smart contracts, and proxy re-encryption algorithms (which are computationally expensive) are implemented using multiple oracles to give access to encrypted shared data stored on a public and decentralized storage platform, such as the Interplanetary File Systems (IPFS). The smart contracts help to validate results based on the majority of encrypted results determined by the oracles. For this, we incorporate reputation mechanisms in the proposed smart contracts to rate the oracles based on their malicious and non-malicious behaviors. We present algorithms along with their full implementation, testing, and validation details. We evaluate the proposed system in terms of security, cost, and generalization to show its reliability and practicality. We make the smart contract source code publicly available on Github. © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.. All rights reserved.},

abstract={As the threat of cyber attack grows ever larger, new approaches to security are required. While there are several different types of intrusion detection systems (IDS), collaborative IDS (CIDS) offers particular promise in identifying distributed, coordinated attacks that might otherwise elude detection. Even for CIDS, there are unresolved issues associated with trusting participants and aggregating data. Blockchain technology appears capable of addressing those issues if practical implementation strategies can be developed. To that end, we implement an Ethereum blockchain-based CIDS leveraging pluggable authentication modules. Our system is specifically crafted to detect doorknob rattling attacks by immutably recording login activity in a blockchain-protected ledger. © 2020 IEEE Computer Society. All rights reserved.},

abstract={WiFi hotspots often suffer from mediocre security, unreliable performance, limited access, and cumbersome authentication procedure. Specifically, public WiFi hotspots can rarely guarantee satisfactory speed and uptime, and their configuration often requires a complicated setup with subscription to a payment aggregator. Moreover, paid hotspots can neither protect clients against low quality or non-service after prepayment, nor do they provide an adequate defense against misuse by the clients. In this paper, we propose SmartWiFi, a universal, secure, and decentralized WiFi hotspot that can be deployed in any public or private environment. SmartWiFi provides cross-domain authentication, fully automated accounting and payments, and security assurance for both hotspots and clients. SmartWiFi utilizes a novel off-chain transaction scheme called Hash Chain-based Network Connectivity Satisfaction Acknowledgement (Hansa), which enables fast and low-cost provider-client protocol by restricting otherwise unacceptable delays and fees associated with blockchain interaction. In addition, we present DupSet, a dynamic user-perceived speed estimation technique, which can reliably evaluate the quality of Internet connection from the users’ perspective. We design and implement SmartWiFi desktop and mobile apps using an Ethereum smart contract. With extensive experimental evaluation, we demonstrate that SmartWiFi exhibits rapid execution with low communication overhead and reduced fees. © ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2020.},

abstract={Subscriber authentication is a primitive operation in mobile networks required by each operator prior to offering any service to end users. In this paper, we propose a novel blockchain-based Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA) protocol for roaming services in 5G networks. Each Home Network (HN) creates its own smart contract and publishes its address to inform other operators who want to offer roaming services to HN subscribers. All subsequent communication between the HN and Serving Network (SN) is done by calling the function of this smart contract. The proposed protocol eliminates the need for a secure channel between the HN and SN, which is a primary requirement of current 5G AKA protocols. In practice, a secure channel requires the HN and SN to establish a secure session before running the AKA protocol. Further, the proposed protocol leverages the benefits of blockchain, such as auditable log, decentralized architecture, and the prevention of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. Furthermore, we provide a security proof of the protocol through formal verification using ProVerif. The results show that our scheme tends to preserve user privacy and at the same time provides mutual authentication of the participants. Finally, our evaluation of the Ethereum blockchain shows that the protocol is efficient in terms of both transaction and execution costs. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Communication security between IoT devices is a major concern in this area, and the blockchain has raised hopes that this concern will be addressed. In the blockchain concept, the majority or even all network nodes check the validity and accuracy of exchanged data before accepting and recording them, whether this data is related to financial transactions or measurements of a sensor or an authentication message. In evaluating the validity of an exchanged data, nodes must reach a consensus in order to perform a special action, in which case the opportunity to enter and record transactions and unreliable interactions with the system is significantly reduced. Recently, in order to share and access management of IoT devices information with distributed attitude a new authentication protocol based on blockchain is proposed and it is claimed that this protocol satisfies user privacy preserving and security. However, in this paper, we show that this protocol has security vulnerabilities against secret disclosure, replay, traceability, and Token reuse attacks with the success probability of 1 and constant complexity of also 1. We also proposed an improved blockchain-based authentication protocol (IBCbAP) that has security properties such as secure access management and anonymity. We implemented IBCbAP using JavaScript programming language and Ethereum local blockchain. We also proved IBCbAP's security both informally and formally through the Scyther tool. Our comparisons showed that IBCbAP could provide suitable security along with reasonable cost. © 2020 Mostafa Yavari et al.},

abstract={One of the crucial parts of the internet is the domain name system, which works as a phonebook of the internet. The protocol is designed to be fast, reliable, and not shielded with a security mechanism, DNSSEC which adds authentication later. However, threats utilising DNS such as DoS/DDoS are increasing daily. On the other hand, blockchain-based DNS is secure by design. By reviewing and comparing it with the current DNS and its ecosystem, it is concluded that blockchain currently has challenges that need to be addressed before it can be adapted as a replacement for the existing DNS.

abstract={Recently, researchers around the world in medical institutions and pharmaceutical companies are demanding a wider access to healthcare data for secondary use in order to provide enhanced and personalized medical services. For this purpose, healthcare information exchange between health authorities can be leveraged as a fundamental concept to meet these demands and enable the discovery of new insights and cures. However, health data are highly sensitive and private information that requires strong authentication and authorization procedures to manage the access to them. In this regard, the cloud paradigm has been used in these e-healthcare solutions, but they remain inefficient due to their inability to adapt to the expanding volume of data generated from body sensors and their vulnerability against cyberattacks. Hence, collaborative and distributed data governance supported by edge computing and blockchain promises enormous potentials in improving the performance and security of the whole system. In this paper, we present a secure and efficient data management framework, named 'EdgeMediChain', for sharing health data. The proposed architecture leverages both edge computing and blockchain to facilitate and provide the necessary requirements for a healthcare ecosystem in terms of scalability, security, as well as privacy. The Ethereum-based testbed evaluations show the effectiveness of EdgeMediChain in terms of execution time with a reduction of nearly 84.75% for 2000 concurrent transactions, higher throughput compared to a traditional blockchain, and scalable ledger storage with a linear growth rate. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Today, internet and device ubiquity are paramount in individual, formal and societal considerations. Next generation communication technologies, such as Blockchains (BC), Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, etc. offer limitless capabilities for different applications and scenarios including industries, cities, healthcare systems, etc. Sustainable integration of healthcare nodes (i.e. devices, users, providers, etc.) resulting in healthcare IoT (or simply IoHT) provides a platform for efficient service delivery for the benefit of care givers (doctors, nurses, etc.) and patients. Whereas confidentiality, accessibility and reliability of medical data are accorded high premium in IoHT, semantic gaps and lack of appropriate assets or properties remain impediments to reliable information exchange in federated trust management frameworks. Consequently, We propose a Blockchain Decentralised Interoperable Trust framework (DIT) for IoT zones where a smart contract guarantees authentication of budgets and Indirect Trust Inference System (ITIS) reduces semantic gaps and enhances trustworthy factor (TF) estimation via the network nodes and edges. Our DIT IoHT makes use of a private Blockchain ripple chain to establish trustworthy communication by validating nodes based on their inter-operable structure so that controlled communication required to solve fusion and integration issues are facilitated via different zones of the IoHT infrastructure. Further, text{C}mathrm {sharp } implementation using Ethereum and ripple Blockchain are introduced as frameworks to associate and aggregate requests over trusted zones. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Recommendation systems are usually evaluated through accuracy and classification metrics. However, when these systems are supported by crowdsourced data, such metrics are unable to estimate data authenticity, leading to potential unreliability. Consequently, it is essential to ensure data authenticity and processing transparency in large crowdsourced recommendation systems. In this work, processing transparency is achieved by explaining recommendations and data authenticity is ensured via blockchain smart contracts. The proposed method models the pairwise trust and system-wide reputation of crowd contributors; stores the contributor models as smart contracts in a private Ethereum network; and implements a recommendation and explanation engine based on the stored contributor trust and reputation smart contracts.

abstract={The IoT offers enormous opportunities and also brings some challenges. Authentication considered one of the main challenges introduced by IoT. IoT devices are not able to protect themselves due to there limited processing and storage capabilities. Researchers proposed authentication algorithms with either a lack of scalability or vulnerable to cyberattacks. In this paper, we propose a decentralized token-based authentication based on fog computing and blockchain. The protocol provides a secure authentication protocol using access token, ECC cryptography, and also blockchain as decentralized identity storage. The blockchain uses cryptographic identifiers, records immutability, and provenance, which allows the implementation of a decentralized authentication protocol. These features ensure a light and secure identity management system. We evaluate this protocol communication between controller, gateways, and devices using AVISPA/ HLPSL, and results obtained from AVISPA simulation shows that our protocol is safe based on secrecy and strong authentication criteria. The paper uses four test cases to test the Ethereum smart contract implementation to ensure the system functions properly. © 2020 Science and Information Organization.},

abstract={These days, IoT devices are deployed at an ever-increasing rate worldwide. It is estimated that the growth of IoT devices will increase up to 31 billion devices by the end of next year. Due to this ever alarming increase in cases of identity theft and data leaks all around the world, authentication has become a major concern. As the IoT devices are resource constraint and incapable of defending, they offer potential points of failure within an IoT-based system themselves. Hence, device authentication and authorization is critical for securing IoT systems, especially when the IoT device holds crucial information like medical data or defense-related data. In this paper, authentication for IoT devices using Ethereum smart contract which is a decentralized approach is discussed. Decentralized application instead of centralized system architecture is preferred much. This system makes use of Ethereum smart contracts to ensure secure authentication of device by the respective user. The key aspects of how the system works, its architecture and the implementation of smart contracts on a local blockchain are discussed. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={Electronic health record (EHR) is a digital format of patient health information which typically contains patient contact information, vital signs, medical history, current and past medication that are outsourced to cloud. But the data leakage in cloud-based EHR causes serious privacy and security issues on various health care organizations. Existing cryptographic methods are not sufficient to address data breaches of EHR data in cloud. Blockchain technology is an emerging technology to solve privacy and security issues of EHR data in a decentralized manner on cloud. In this paper, we have designed a secure decentralized cloud-based medical block chain (CMBC) to solve privacy and security issues when exchanging the patient health care data to different medical organizations. Before uploading the EHR data to cloud-based block chain, the data are encrypted using lightweight authentication encryption algorithm AES_256_GCM to achieve better performance in health care. Based on the encrypted data on blockchain, Etherum based solidity smart code to restrict the access of EHR data on cloud. The medical blockchain also maintains the interoperability, traceability and anonymity of patients EHR data between various organizations. So the secure decentralized cloud-based medical block chain visualizes the patient EHR data in decentralized, distributed and immutable environment with improved security. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={DigiLocker, a government of India initiative, provides a free platform to the citizens of India to store and access important personal documents. This platform is implemented by using various open source technologies to deliver a mass solution and contributes back to the ever-growing Indian community. DigiLocker is a weapon for paperless E-governance. It is a platform to issue and verify all types of certificates and documents digitally. Thus gradually eliminate the use of physical documents. In this paper, we have proposed a framework to secure individual information using secured verification method of blockchain-based validation technique. The proposed framework ensures proper validation and verification with a unique hash key. Additionally, Argon2 encryption mechanism is used for securing the hash key in the proposed framework. This will enable a timeline for visibility of the uploaded documents by any authorized person/organization and reduce fraudulent use of documents. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

abstract={The wide deployment of tokens for digital assets on top of Ethereum implies the need for powerful trading platforms. Vickrey auctions have been known to determine the real market price of items as bidders are motivated to submit their own monetary valuations without leaking their information to the competitors. Recent constructions have utilized various cryptographic protocols such as ZKP and MPC, however, these approaches either are partially privacy-preserving or require complex computations with several rounds. In this paper, we overcome these limits by presenting Trustee as a Vickrey auction on Ethereum which fully preserves bids’ privacy at relatively much lower fees. Trustee consists of three components: a front-end smart contract deployed on Ethereum, an Intel SGX enclave, and a relay to redirect messages between them. Initially, the enclave generates an Ethereum account and ECDH key-pair. Subsequently, the relay publishes the account’s address and ECDH public key on the smart contract. As a prerequisite, bidders are encouraged to verify the authenticity and security of Trustee by using the SGX remote attestation service. To participate in the auction, bidders utilize the ECDH public key to encrypt their bids and submit them to the smart contract. Once the bidding interval is closed, the relay retrieves the encrypted bids and feeds them to the enclave that autonomously generates a signed transaction indicating the auction winner. Finally, the relay submits the transaction to the smart contract which verifies the transaction’s authenticity and the parameters’ consistency before accepting the claimed auction winner. As part of our contributions, we have made a prototype for Trustee available on Github for the community to review and inspect it. Additionally, we analyze the security features of Trustee and report on the transactions’ gas cost incurred on Trustee smart contract. © 2020, International Financial Cryptography Association.},

abstract={The art market is an important scenario where many players (artists, buyers, sellers, brokers, etc.) act in a context with partial trust, and still it is crucial to ensure authentication and provenance of artworks. In this paper, we propose to store artworks information and ownership in distributed public ledgers. To this end, we present a distributed, scalable application which provides the main operations for operating on the art market. This application is composed by a back-end based on Ethereum ledger and the IPFS distributed file system, where the data is kept and manipulated by means of suitable Solidity smart contracts; and a web-based front-end. In this way, we obtain the robustness and scalability of Ethereum public ledger with the easiness of common web applications (or even mobile apps). The solution we propose could be applied to similar traceability contexts, where we have to deal with many partners with limited (or no) trust. Copyright © 2020 for this paper by its authors.},

abstract={The proliferation of IoT devices across various application domains led to a high level of heterogeneity which introduced new device management challenges. These challenges include, bringing the capability of the service delivery and the underlying accounting, authentication and authorization mechanisms. Moreover, IoT devices tend to no longer require a centralized authority to authenticate and authorize access to the services offered. In this work, we address this by introducing a decentralized Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA) framework using Capability-based Tokens based on the ERC721 standard to provide secure authentication and authorization for IoT devices. The approach is tested on a private Ethereum Blockchain node to analyze performance factors related to access time, timeout ratio and overhead. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

abstract={Centralized systems based on the trusted third-party are widely used in identity authentication. However, there is a single point of failure inherent in the centralized systems. As a natural decentralized architecture, blockchain can bring the advantages of decentralization, trustworthiness and immutability to the identity authentication systems. The existing blockchain-based identity authentication systems can solve the problem of single point of failure, but there are still problems such as certificate management. In this paper, we propose an identity authentication scheme based on blockchain and certificateless public key cryptography. The scheme implements a decentralized database by deploying smart contracts in the Ethereum blockchain, and uses the certificateless public key signature algorithm during the authentication process. Compared with other blockchain-based identity authentication systems, our scheme not only prevents the single point of failure, but also avoids the deficiency of certificate management, and resists impersonation attacks and man-in-the-middle attacks. The security analysis and performance analysis show the security and stability of our scheme. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2020.},

abstract={Blockchain, the underlying technology for Bitcoin, is a distributed digital ledger technology that enables record verification by many independent parties rather than a centralized authority, therefore making it more difficult to tamper with the data. This emerging technology has the potential to enhance various authentication and verification processes in image sharing and data security. It has the potential to promote patient-centered healthcare by giving greater control to patients over their own data. Blockchain can also be utilized for administrative tasks, such as credentialing, claims adjudication, and billing management. It can also be utilized to enhance software supporting research and clinical trials. Blockchain complements artificial intelligence (AI) and these can work synergistically to create better solutions. Although many challenges exist for increased adoption of blockchain within radiology and healthcare in general, it can play a major role in our practice and consequently, it is important for medical imaging professionals to become familiar with the technology. © 2019},

abstract={Blockchain is decentralized architecture, where data are stored in the form of blocks for processing. The data has to be transferred from one person to another with safety and security and updated with smart contract in the blockchain. But there are some challenges such as data spoofing, integrity, authentication of the data. In the health sector the privacy of the patients' data has to be maintained. The proposed system, 'Insurance Management in Healthcare Sector' uses blockchain combined with identity management to access the identity of a person when authorized by the person. After verifying the details, the insured amount will be transferred to the policy holder or the hospital with the help of matching smart contracts in the blockchain of the Ethereum platform. As a result, the insurance claim can reach the policy holder who has initiated the claim process with proof of work. The other use cases such as health care industries, social media networks are also discussed and the analysis of how the blockchain can be used in various fields. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={In the current copyright law and technology environment, two prominent problems must be considered when enforcing and executing copyrights: (i) the difficulty of proving author-ship/ownership of a copyright; and (ii) the difficulty of conducting copyright transactions. The invention of blockchain technology has made it possible to solve these two issues. First, the use of blockchain technology with the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is an excellent mechanism for copyright authentication and document preservation. This mechanism allows authors (copyright owners) to prove authorship of their works and copyrights ownership. However, this mechanism for copyright authentication and document preservation may not be applicable in the future primarily because the computer software currently used may be upgraded in the following years. Second, the combination of Ethereum Blockchain and smart contracts can reduce transaction costs and enhance the efficiency of copyright assignments and licensing transactions. However, many legal problems regarding smart contracts have yet to be addressed. These problems include identifying the contracting parties in the anonymous blockchain network, dealing with scenarios where both contracting parties want to amend the implemented smart contracts, explaining code-based smart contracts and setting up an internal dispute resolution mechanism. Unlike the traditional transmission control protocol/Internet protocol network, where any activity is traceable, users on blockchain technology remain anonymous and their activities on the blockchain are hardly traceable. Although the blockchain itself is unlikely to become a hotbed of copyright infringement, the combination of the Ethereum Blockchain, the IPFS and smart contracts may make the entire process a hotbed of copyright infringement. Therefore, this situation poses considerable worries regarding copyright infringement on the blockchain. When the decentralized and anonymized blockchain and peripheral technologies mature, they will have considerable influence on copyright protection. This problem must be addressed by the copyright legal system in the current wave of blockchain technology implementation. © 2019 The Author and 2019 Edward Elgar Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Blockchain technology back in 2009 was mainly used for finance use cases due to the cryptocurrency support of the Bitcoin and the Ethereum networks. Nowadays with the emergence of business oriented distributed ledger frameworks we can find blockchain (BC) in almost every aspect of our everyday real-life transactions. Starting with supply chain, BC has been used to support and secure education, e-government, real estate, insurance, healthcare and other business cases. Regarding blockchain in supply chain, examples as the Walmart and IBM partnership shows that smart contracts (SC) and cryptocurrencies can disrupt the way suppliers, shippers, retailers and customers trust each other and interact. This paper describes how we applied BC technology in two real-life supply chain scenarios. The first one is for logging and tracing products, showing how we can use SCs to identify the ingredients of food products and how to uniquely identify the food product throughout its shipment from the factory to the customer who purchase it. Important aspects of this route is the transparency of the process as well as the verification of transport. The second one deals with how authentication works for users holding BC identities. The identity of a user is important in order to secure the network, allowing only permissioned parties to access it and perform actions on the data. As long as the network is private and immutable, authenticating and authorizing users is crucial for enforcing the end-to-end security to increase users’ trust and protect the confidentiality of data. While exploring these two scenarios we define the actors, the transactions these actors can perform on the systems and we propose the SCs that have to be implemented for these use cases to take advantage of BC’s unique characteristics, as immutability and non-repudiation. In addition, we provide sample template SCs for both scenarios. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={Ethereum, a blockchain-based distributed computing platform, provides smart contract functionality. It also provides Ethereum virtual machine (EVM) that can execute peer-to-peer contracts across decentralized network. However, the gas consumption of smart contract is so costly that it becomes one of the important problems to be solved. The purpose of this paper is to provide a conceptual overview of blockchain based electricity billing system with the aim of lessening gas consumption of the smart contract. In this system, Firebase is employed as a data storage while Ethereum blockchain acts as both a cryptocurrency payment system and an authentication channel. Moreover, this paper illustrates two-factor authentication by utilizing Ethereum account and Firebase Authentication as an authentication channel. Results show that by utilizing Firebase with blockchain, the transaction cost of each transaction made on Ethereum is decreased by approximately 73%. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Thanks to the popularity of smartphones with megapixel cameras, people would like to capture and share their daily life by means of photos, which results billions of photos uploaded onto Internet every day. However, photo-faking is an extremely easy task at present, since digital photo editing tools are more and more popular and powerful. Besides, due to the lack of copyright protection mechanisms, photo owners lose control of their photos after uploading the photos to Internet. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based photo forensics scheme in order to uniformly solve photo-faking problems, photo-tracing problems and copyright dispute problems. We combine blockchain technology with image authentication technologies and propose a new mining protocol to stimulate miners to verify photos for users. The scheme allows users to define their own access control rules and provides on-chain photo proofs with which one can verify the copyright of photos and trace the operating histories of them. We implement the system on Ethereum platform and analyze the security of the system. Compared with other schemes, our scheme has the ability of photo forensics with authentication, copyright protection and traceability. In addition, our system allows a variety of permissible transformations without adding additional storage overhead. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The microgrid trading market can effectively solve the problem of in-situ consumption of distributed energy and reduce the impact of distributed generation (DG) on the grid. However, the traditional microgrid trading model has some shortcomings, such as high operation cost and poor security. Therefore, in this paper, a microgrid market trading model was developed using consortium blockchain technology and Nash game equilibrium theory. Firstly, blockchain container is used to authenticate the users who want to participate in the transaction. Then, the pricing system collects and integrates transaction requests submitted by users, then formulates transaction pricing strategy of microgrid using Nash equilibrium theory. Finally, the price, trading volume, and user information are submitted to the blockchain container for transaction matching to achieve the transaction. After the transaction is completed, its related information is recorded in the hyperledger and the dispatch system is called. The scene simulation was implemented on Fabric 1.1 platform and the results analyzed. Results show that the trading model proposed in this paper greatly reduces the cost of electricity purchase and improves the benefits of electricity sales. Besides, the model is far more capable of handling transactions than the models based on Bitcoin and Ethereum. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) systems are almost a part of our daily lives. The security of this new paradigm had always faced many challenge in order to insure user privacy and authentication. These security issues are still far from being solved by the classical centralized architectures which reaches their limits in terms of scalability especially when thousands or tens of thousands of IoT devices are connected in the same network. To remedy this architectural issue, we rely on blockchains in order to propose a simple and lightweight blockchain-based authentication solution for IoT systems. We provided a real implementation of our proposed scheme relying on Ethereum blockchain and using different devices in order to confirm its feasibility and evaluate its initial performances. The results obtained confirm its suitability to such environments. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Data leaks and privacy scandals have been a growing concern of the last decade. While most traditional, i.e., centralized, online platforms require users to register with their personal data, they potentially expose the user's identity and data to be used for unintended purposes. This work proposes TradeMap as an integrated architecture, designing and enabling an online end-to-end (e2e) trading market place, while supporting anonymous management features. TradeMap addresses the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) regulations by designing a FINMA-complaint Know Your Customer (KYC) platform. Additionally, TradeMap is based on blockchains and employs Ethereum Smart Contracts (SC). Thus, trust and anonymity between the market place and the KYC system relies on zero knowledge proof-based SCs used for user identification processes. With this management approach proposed, the user authentication is only verified within the KYC platform, providing a legally valid and fully anonymous online trading platform. © 2019 IFIP.},

abstract={Enterprises are no doubt interested in reaching data collected from billions of Internet of Things (IoT) devices which opens a huge potential business. The main concern remains the security challenges from the distribution of key while using public key cryptography. To ensure that IOT connected devices can be trusted to be what they are supposed to be, robust IoT device authentication is mandated. Each IoT device therefore requires a unique identity which can be verified when the device tries to link to an intermediate device. One of the early solutions used to secure data transmission among parties in public networks is the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) which is used to distribute and manage public keys (digital certificates) among different parties and these certificates are generated upon request by Certificate Authorities (CA). Nevertheless, for billions of devices connected to IoT and mobile phones, the distribution management of certificates for each client proved to be inefficient. In this research, we propose a decentralized authentication platform based on PKI and Ethereum Blockchain. The public key certificates are stored in a decentralized fashion and the private keys are stored inside the devices themselves. It also includes a protocol for Pre-Shared Keys (PSK) distribution. PSK keys are then used by PSK-based security protocols for securing the communication channel between two devices. This platform includes a client-side module, a server-side Wallet Management Function, and a smart contract deployed on the Ethereum Blockchain network. This platform can be used by applications for end devices and/or intermediate devices authentication and a secure Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication. The proposed platform is validated by the implementation of a Secure Session Establishment between IoT devices. Results show that the solution implementation has minimal impact on the existing networks, and the secure session setup time between two devices is negligible compared to the existing security methods. Eventually, this scheme can help removing the trust requirement placed on clients by the current PKI/CAs infrastructure. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) contain private and sensitive information of the patients and require distribution across multiple stakeholders for sustained and consistent medical care. EMRs are owned and maintained by hospital systems. So, patients often face difficulties in getting their data shared among different stakeholders. Blockchain provides distributed, transparent, and immutable log of records that benefit the design of healthcare systems. There have been several studies done to use Blockchain technology as a mediation tool for sharing sensitive EMRs between multiple stakeholders in the e-health care system. However, these studies lack the requirement of patients to have full control over their EMR data. This work develops PACEX, PAtient-Centric EMR eXchange, that enables patients to share and have complete control over their data using Blockchain. In PACEX, we develop an easy-to-use patient application that interacts with different hospital systems and handles EMR exchanges with integrity. We developed a proof of concept implementation of PACEX using Ethereum Blockchain and Smart Contracts to achieve access control and maintain a history of record exchanges among different stakeholders. The evaluation results provide the quantitative analysis that gives time estimates for various transactions involved in PACEX and the qualitative analysis that describes the security properties of the system. PACEX achieves essential security requirements such as Authentication, Integrity, Access Control, and Traceability over the EMR data exchange. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) has lots of attention in the last decade. The connected IoT devices are more than the total world population. Due to its low cost, easy to deploy, and simple to implement, application areas are large like smart city, smart home, smart transportation, environment monitoring, agriculture and many more. There exists some security and privacy challenges in IoT system. The device identification is one of the challenges in any IoT application. Authentication is one of the processes to identify the device. Though some work has been done on this problem, most of these are using a centralized system. In this paper, we have proposed a distributed authentication system using the Blockchain technology The implementation of the proposed authentication is done on Ethereum platform for its better results in order to justify it as a superior scheme. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={The keystone of information security has been access control. Very often, User data is misused and users are oblivious to the use of their data by unauthorized parties. Current strategies to provide storage for confidential data and subsequent authentication involve relying on a trusted third party for the same, which could be victims of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks or technical failures. This paper examines a strategy where the underlying framework for providing Access Control is the blockchain, hence decentralizing the mechanism of providing access control. Further in this paper, we demonstrate and model the User Data access on the Ethereum framework. Personal Information of the user by a website or an application is retrieved on a need-to-know basis from the off-blockchain, as determined by the user, the true owner of the data. Personal data is highly protected and the different permissions to different websites or applications are determined by the Smart Contract. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={The importance of the Internet of Things is constantly growing, together with the proliferation of IoT devices which are changing our daily life and empowering industrial processes. However, the most IoT devices and protocols were not designed with security in mind, and economic and energyconsumption constraints make the implementation of security measures a non-trivial problem. One of the most used messaging protocol in IoT, which is MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport), leaves to developers the task to implement security, as native security services provided by the protocol are very weak. This paper focuses on MQTT authentication, which is definitely insecure in the protocol, even though the implementations can combine MQTT with other mechanisms to obtain a suitable level of security. The aim of the present work is to propose an innovative OTP-authentication scheme for MQTT which uses Ethereum to implement an independent logic channel for the second-factor authentication. The implementation of the proposed scheme relies on the trusted behavior of smart contracts and adopts suitable strategies to preserve the privacy of users. © 2019 ACM.},

abstract={RBAC is a traditional approach of controlling who wants to access resources in a computer system through a permission to a role. Blockchain is an open, distributed ledger that can permanently record transactions. Smart Contract facilitates negotiations for a trustless transaction by enabling automatic payment. It is currently being applied to various kinds of business applications. In a smart contract that requires payment with cryptocurrency, if access control is performed only without individual authentication, progress for applications to various fields will be restricted. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based RBAC with an authentication mechanism that can provides role-based access control while also providing individual account-based authentication. We have defined three interfaces based on blockchain to realize it. The proposed mechanism provides anonymity-based authentication by using a hash function with a pass that is indistinguishable from the owner. This was simulated on an Ethereum-based test network and compared with existing methods. The proposed mechanism not only added authentication methods, but also was more efficient in gas use and performance time than the existing RBAC model. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.},

This paper addresses the causes and solutions to that attack. Private Transactions like the techniques implemented in Parity Ethereum and Quorum are introduced. Proof of Stack (POS) is another approach using economic incentives instead of intensive computations to guard against attacks while reducing power consumed. They are considered mitigation to the '51% Attack'. The use of Second Factor Authentication at the Smart Contract level is also addressed. © 2019 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract={Blockchain is one of emerging research area and gaining attention due to its wide range of applications. Smart contracts are one of the latest application areas of blockchain, which enables secure, transparent and tamperproof transactions. Smart contracts create and verify the data with the help of hash functions. Hash functions are mathematical algorithms that take input and produces hashed output of specified length. It is very difficult to regenerate the original input from the hashed output. Ethereum is one of the leading blockchain platforms to provide functionality of smart contracts. This paper carries out study of blockchain on Ethereum platform. We have developed authentication-based business application with the help of smart contract for marketing services on Ethereum platform.

abstract={A decentralized private Blockchain implementation for academic document storage and document verification can add self-sovereignty to the process. It can dramatically minimize the time and cost of verification at various layers of verification. Blockchain would remove all the layers at all and it will provide immediate auditing of any document. So, the request and response will be truly real time in our case.Apart from speeding up the verification process, it will also increase the security of personal education data and will check all kind of misuse also. Putting documents on Blockchain would increase the security, because all the data would only be accessible by private key and proper authentication to that private key.We are proposing a private Blockchain that would be managed by some private vendors and only those vendors will take part in consensus. So, we are using proof of stake consensus in our case. We are using private IPFS database server for storing our documents over Blockchain. We are considering Ethereum Blockchain ecosystem in our case. Alternatively we can also use Hyperledger Fabric for implementation but that discussion is out of the scope for current document. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Development of intelligent systems in particular Water Distribution Systems (WDS) increases the demand of implementing a secure scheme that can preserve user's identification and data consumption through maintaining confidentiality, authentication and integrity. Decentralization topology has investigated a lot recently in the literature with the development of bitcoins and Ethereum networks in different IoT disciplines such as power systems and healthcare systems. In this paper, feasibility and uses cases studies on the integration WDS with Blockchain Technology are discussed. Moreover, the customer's data and identity anonymity techniques that can be integrated with the network are discussed. Furthermore, a data aggregation mechanism of the smart meters in Water Distribution System (WDS) based on distributed ledger and Blockchain technologies is proposed. Further, the customer's identity using bloom filter is simulated and optimal parameters of the bloom filter are suggested. © 2019 Chinese Automation and Computing Society in the UK-CACSUK.},

abstract={With the rise of blockchain technology, peer-to-peer network system has once again caught people's attention. Peer-to-peer (P2P) is currently being implemented on various kind of decentralized systems such as InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). However, P2P file sharing network systems is not without its flaws. Data stored in the other nodes cannot be deleted by the owner and can only be deleted by other nodes themselves. Ensuring that personal data can be completely removed is an important issue to comply with the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) criteria. To improve P2Ps privacy and security, we propose a monitorable peer-to-peer file sharing mechanism that synchronizes with other nodes to perform file deletion and to generate the File Authentication Code (FAC) of each IPFS nodes in order to make sure the system synchronized correctly. The proposed mechanism can integrate with a consortium Blockchain to comply with GDPR. © 2019 IEICE.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the most promising areas for research in the last decade. The numbers of IoT enabled devices developed makes the application of IoT more interesting. The application areas are Insurance sector, Smart Environment Monitoring, Smart City, Healthcare Sector, Smart Transportation, and Agriculture Sector among many other smart device enabled applications. IoT implementation relays on different security and privacy challenges. To make use of IoT in real-life application confidentiality, integrity, authentication, authorization, trust, verification, information storage, and management, availability challenges need to be addressed. In this work, authors have used the decentralized Blockchain technology to address security and privacy issues in IoT enabled applications. Initially, the paper identifies and explained the security and privacy challenges that currently exist in IoT applications. Ethereum virtual machine is used to implement the Blockchain distributed network and healthcare insurance claims is taken as an example to test the proposed solution. Results show that the distributed Blockchain technique provides trust management and address some of the existing security and privacy challenges of IoT enable healthcare insurance sector. © IJSTR 2019.},

abstract={Most blockchain-based identity authentication systems focus on using blockchain to establish the public key infrastructure (PKI). It can solve the problem of single point of failure and certificate transparency faced by traditional PKI systems, but there are still some problems such as complex certificate management and complex certificate usage process. In this paper, we propose an identity authentication scheme based on blockchain and identity-based cryptography (IBC). The scheme implements a decentralized private key generator (PKG) by deploying the smart contract in Ethereum blockchain, and uses the IBC signature algorithm and challenge-response protocol during the authentication process. Compared with other blockchain-based identity authentication systems, the scheme not only prevents the single point of failure, but also avoids the complex certificate management, has lower system complexity, and resists impersonation attack, man-in-The-middle attack and replay attack. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={The emerging blockchain technology, powered by the smart contract functionality, is expected to revolutionize traditional systems by decentralization and autonomy. When the blockchain technology is applied in real-life systems, a smart contract may need to take in sensitive data to execute its code. For example, a decentralized medical insurance smart contract needs access to personal health data. Therefore, it is crucial to guarantee both privacy and authenticity of data sent to the smart contract, so that everyone can verify data without leaking sensitive information. Currently, only few works have tried to achieve privacy and authenticity at the same time. In this work, we first propose zk-DASNARK, a zero-knowledge SNARK scheme for authenticated data. It is designed by combining the zk-SNARK technique with digital signature in an effective way. Based on zk-DASNARK, we design zk-AuthFeed, a zero-knowledge authenticated data feed scheme to achieve both data privacy and authenticity for smart contract. We implement zk-AuthFeed and conduct comprehensive experiments on Ethereum. The experiments show that zk-AuthFeed is highly efficient: key generation takes about 7 seconds only, proof generation takes less than 2 seconds, and proof verification takes less than 40 ms. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) as per estimated will connect 50 billion devices by 2020. Since its evolution, IoT technology provides lots of flexibility to develop and implement any application. Most of the application improves the human living standard and also makes life easy to access and monitoring the things in real time. Though there exist some security and privacy issues in IoT system like authentication, computation, data modification, trust among users. In this paper, we have identified the IoT application like insurance, supply chain system, smart city and smart car where trust among associated users is an major issue. The current centralized system does not provide enough trust between users. Using Blockchain technology we have shown that trust issue among users can be managed in a decentralized way so that information can be traceable and identify/verify any time. Blockchain has properties like distributed, digitally share and immutable which enhance security. For Blockchain implementation, Ethereum platform is used. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={The importance and usage of the distributed cloud is increasing rapidly over a traditionally centralized cloud for the storing and exchanging of digital assets between untrusted parties in many business sectors. Storing the digital assets in the distributed cloud is considered superior to traditional cloud computing in terms of environmentally friendly, cost, security and other technical dimensions. In this article, a contemporary architecture DistProv is proposed where an open source distributed cloud IPFS is used to store and transfer the digital assets between the consignor and consignee. These two are untrusted parties exchanging sensitive documents secured by cryptographic algorithms with permission-based access verified by ethereum smart contracts using zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) and simultaneously publishing the provenance data about the digital asset as a transaction on the blockchain. This article also discusses on verifying the integrity of the digital assets and authentication of the consignor and thus preserving a strong CIA triad. Copyright © 2019, IGI Global.},

abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) is growing at an exponential rate but the area of privacy and security in IoT still remains unexplored. The existing algorithms or methods are mainly centralized and hence they are vulnerable due to their single point authentication topology. As it has been estimated that by 2020 there will be more ‘things’ than people on this earth the problem of security becomes a major concern in IoT networks, as a person having control to an IoT network will be able to control a large portion of an organization. Blockchain has recently been used to provide security to peer-to-peer networks. Blockchains are computationally expensive, heavyweight and are considered unsuitable for IoT architecture. In this paper a new lightweight and secure architecture for IoT by using Ethereum Blockchain retaining most of its security providing powers is proposed. Since Blockchain is decentralized it solves the single point authentication problem existing in IoT networks. A Smart Home System as a representative case study has been implemented for broader IoT applications. The two parameters measured are temperature and intrusion detection. The proposed model tackles some more challenges that exist in IoT networks. The Qualitative evaluation of the proposed architecture highlights how it tackles various attacks. ©BEIESP.},

abstract={Goal: The present work aims to present how the use of a blockchain two-factor authentication solution 2FA on a page developed on WordPress can contribute to the information security regarding user authentication. Design/Methodology/Approach: The research method employed is characterized as an exploratory research, since all the analysis is based on the theoretical reference data available on the subject. A field research was carried out in relation to the implementation of the multi-factor authentication plugin Hydro Raindrop MFA, which uses blockchain technology offered by The Hydrogen Technology Corporation and the Project Hydro platform over the Ethereum network. Thus, this paper sought to present and conceptualize some of the technologies used, pointing out their contribution to information security. Results: The main results showed that the use of decentralized technology, such as block-chain and the Hydro Raindrop Plugin, can contribute considerably in the process of user authentication, which may strengthen the safeguard of the information and assets of in-dividuals and organizations by inhibiting or reducing the possibility of successful hacker attacks. This solution is at the forefront of innovation with regard to data security because it uses advanced blockchain technology. It might contribute in a satisfactory way to the preservation of critical data and information that are the core value of many organizations of the industry 4.0. Limitations of the investigation: This research was limited to analyzing how the implementation of the Hydro Raindrop multi-factor authentication solution on a WordPress page can be beneficial to ensure information security. Practical implications: This study’s findings can contribute to entities interested in cyber-security. As a suggestion for future works, analyses of plugins or similar solutions available on the market in distinct types of websites, or performance comparisons between them, may be relevant to contribute to scientific research. Originality/Value: This work can contribute in an innovative way to scientific research, since it addresses a recently created solution that uses blockchain technology as its basis for a safer method of authentication. © 2019, Associacao Brasileira de Engenharia de Producao.

abstract={Biometrics have been used increasingly heavily for identity authentication in many critical public services, such as border passes or security check points. However, traditional biometrics-based identity management systems collect and store personal biometrical data in a centralized server or database, and an individual has no control over how her biometrics will be used for what purpose. Such kind of systems can result in serious security and privacy issues for sensitive personal data. In this paper, we design a novel approach to leveraging biometrics and blockchain/smart contract to enable secure and privacy preserving identity management. The basic idea is to use blockchain to store an authority's attestation and the transformed value of an individual's biometrics. The stored data on the blockchain is then controlled by smart contracts which define various access control policies, e.g., access parties, access times, etc. The owner of the biometrical data can flexibly change the access control policies through a white list, a timer and other methods to any identity verifiers. We used the well-known Ethereum platform to implement the proposed approach and tested the effectiveness as well as the flexibility of various access control policies. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper presents a work on how to assure the dependability of a crypto system built across on and off the blockchain by using the proposed adaptive checkpoint and rollback algorithm, and a prototype is developed for demonstration purpose.The theoretical background of the proposed checkpoint and rollback algorithm is studied to characterize the variables affecting the dependability such as security, authenticity and reliability with respect to the rates of hit by any events of those issues, the rates to detect and diagnose, and then the rate to vote for a consensus whether to trigger a rollback or not. Based on the variables characterization in a stochastic manner, then steady state probabilities and state transition probabilities are derived in order to assure the ultimate effective dependability of each individual dependability variable (i.e., security, authenticity and reliability), then finally to assure the dependability in a compound manner with each variable assigned a weight depending on the nature of the systems specifications.Based on the theoretical study, a protype of a crypto system is built to demonstrated the underlying architecture and operations and to justify the need for such system to take synergistic advantages from both on- and off-chain blockchains, with an experimental result of a benefit in gas fee which is the most exigently addressed issue today in blockchain systems especially in Ethereum network of blockchains. An astonishing gas fee saving results are demonstrated. It is observed that the crypto system benefits more if more computationally intensive transactions are executed off-chain while vice versa. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Recently, there has been increasing interest in employing blockchain in different applications, other than crypto-currencies. Blockchains allow a peer to peer distributed network where different nodes communicate with each other, in a trustless manner. Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) is an Internet of Things (IoT) technology, which enables long range communication. Although LoRaWAN networks are secure, the LoRaWAN join procedure is susceptible to replay and jamming attacks. Moreover, trust between network server and LoRa end device is the basic foundation of LoRaWAN network however, the centralized nature of network servers raise trust issues between network operators and customers. To solve this problem, we propose a lightweight two factor authentication mechanism for LoRaWAN join procedure, based on blockchain technology. The proposed blockchain based framework provides an extra layer of security for LoRaWAN join procedure and build trust among LoRaWAN network components. The proposed framework is validated using the Ethereum blockchain. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework provides efficient system performance in terms of throughput and latency. The proposed blockchain architecture is a cost effective solution, which can be utilized in the LoRaWAN network with few network servers and LoRa end device, having no strict requirement of throughput and latency. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Data Dissemination is the distribution of data/statistics to the end users. With the adoption of Internet of Drones (IoD) environment for data dissemination, an efficient scheme is proposed which provides data integrity, identity anonymity, authentication, authorization, accountability (AAA) to the system model. We propose a system model having Ethereum based public blockchain distributed network in order to secure drone communication for the data collection and transmission. The proposed model provides secure communication between the drones and the users in a decentralized way. In this paper, blockchain technology is used for the storage of collected data from the drones and update the information into the distributed ledgers to reduce the burden of drones. It also provides integrity, authentication, and authorization to the collected data by the drones in the system model. Motivated by this consideration, the goal of this paper is threefold. First, we select a forger node from the number of drones. Second, we create blocks and validate their processes. Third, we provide secure data dissemination by applying Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. Afterward, we evaluate the security of the presented system model compared against the corresponding ones of some state-of-the-art in terms of communication time/cost. The results confirm that our system model is reliable and scalable for data dissemination in the IoD environment. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Over the last few years, interest has emerged in blockchain, a decentralized ledger technology (DLT) created for use in cryptocurrencies, but with a great potential to be used in other application domains. One of them is supply chain management, tracking and tracing, whichare key processes to the logistics industry, made difficult due to lack of standards or trust between actors, miscommunication, fraud, bureaucratic delays, among other issues. In order to overcome some of these challenges, the solution presented in this article proposes a blockchain system application created with Ethereum smart contracts technology, to be used in supply chain and logistics for tracking and tracing products through the storage of valuabledata in a trustworthy and decentralized system. The technical solution presented here implements methods for automated tracking, certification and authentication, and integrates the communication of blockchain with IoT devices, which play a role in monitoring products and automating the tracking and clearance processes. We validate our approach by developing an application that highlights the benefits of these technologies applied to logistics, ultimatelygiving insight into the capabilities, qualities, but also limitations a system like this can have. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={One of the most common actions for students post-graduation is requesting a degree validation or an official transcript of grades. Requests for degree validations happen for various reasons such as an employment requirement, a pursuit of a higher degree education, foreign degree accreditation, or even for a personal reason. Those who are requesting the degree validation are usually on a time constraint. Traditional methods of degree validation are often complicated, time consuming, require manpower to maintain, and potentially have security or privacy issues. We present a software application implementing an automatic degree validation system that uses the Ethereum, an open-source, public, blockchain-based distributed computing platform, and that features smart contract functionality. The application is developed using Solidity, a contract-oriented programming language, and is run by the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This application allows students and universities to automatically verify each other's identity while maintaining transaction validity and referential integrity through a blockchain ledger and maintaining security through PGP key authentication. The university checks the student's request against its own secure mongoDB database. Our application also generates the student's Ehereum wallet using the Truffle development Ethereum network. Truffle generates the student's private and public keys. Our Application pulls the student public key, hashes the last 20 bytes, generates Keccak256 Hash, and stores it on the MongoDB as the student Ethereum Address. To ensure the information's privacy, the blocks of the blockchain are mainly formed of two encrypted fields using the Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme (ECIES) library. The first field is encrypted using the student's public key and the second field is encrypted using the third party public field. Third parties, such as employers or other higher education institutions, are able to check its encrypted field of the block using its own private key, once the degree is validated or the transcript is generated. Results of testing show our application to be scalable, secure, have efficient gas costs on the Ethereum network, and minimize human interaction. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Blockchain, as the underlying technique of cryptocurrency, has triggered a wave of innovation in decentralized computing. Despite some research on blockchain data query, a primary concern for blockchain to be fully practical is to combat the data query inefficiency and query result authenticity. To provide both efficient and verifiable data query services for blockchain-based systems, we propose a Verifiable Query Layer (VQL). The middleware layer extracts transactions stored in the underlying blockchain system and efficiently reorganizes them in databases to provide various query services for public users. To prevent falsified data being stored in the middleware, a cryptographic hash value is calculated for each constructed database. The database fingerprint including the hash value and some database properties will be first verified by miners and then stored in the blockchain. We implement VQL and conduct extensive experiments based on a practical blockchain system Ethereum. The evaluation results demonstrate that VQL can effectively support various data query services and guarantee the authenticity of query results for the blockchain system. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Space situation awareness (SSA) includes tracking of active and inactive resident space objects and assessing the space environment through sensor data collection and processing. To enhance SSA, the dynamic data-driven application systems framework couples online data with offline models to enhance performance by using feedback control, sensor management, and communications reliability. For information management, there is a need for identity authentication and access control (AC) to ensure the integrity of exchanged data as well as to grant authorized entities access right to data and services. Due to decentralization and heterogeneity of SSA systems, it is challenging to build an efficient centralized AC system, which can either be a performance bottleneck or the single point of failure. Inspired by the blockchain and smart contract technology, we introduce blockchain-enabled, decentralized, capability-based access control (BlendCAC), a decentralized authentication, and capability-based AC mechanism to enable effective protection for devices, services, and information in SSA networks. To achieve secure identity authentication, the BlendCAC leverages the blockchain to create virtual trust zones, in which distributed components can identify and update each other in a trustless network environment. A robust identity-based capability token management strategy is proposed, which takes advantage of the smart contract for registration, propagation, and revocation of the access authorization. A proofof-concept prototype has been implemented on both resources-constrained devices (i.e., Raspberry Pi nodes emulating satellites with sensor observations) and more powerful computing devices (i.e., laptops emulating a ground network) and is tested on a private Ethereum blockchain network. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the BlendCAC scheme to offer a decentralized, scalable, lightweight, and fine-grained AC solution for space system toward SSA. © 2019 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).},

abstract={Ever-increasing transaction costs, serious network congestion, and low transaction rates in the current blockchain systems restrict their extensive use. To relieve from this situation, we present a secure versatile light payment (SVLP) scheme. The SVLP merely employs a digital signature algorithm and a one-way function and has similar security comparing to existing blockchain systems, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. The proposed scheme is of ultra-low power consumption, since the payers and payees only need one-way functions to achieve multiple transactions, instead of the costly digital signature algorithms. Furthermore, the processes of payment and refunding are flexible. This is due to the fact that the denomination in our scheme possesses divisibility and the users need not to verify the preimages on the long chain one-by-one. Finally, as the transaction can be taken off-chain and offline, it can be even used in remote areas or geological disasters areas where communication infrastructures are lacked or destroyed. All these features indicate that our scheme is practical and versatile. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In the domain of Internet of things there are large number of devices generating data in the network and submitting it to their respective configured data collectors. When the sensors are preconfigured by the data collectors, they can easily verify the data coming from those sensors for its authenticity using cryptography. But if a third party wants to buy that data, how can they trust the data collector for the authenticity of that data i.e whether the data they are buying is real data or some randomly generated stream of numbers. In fact, the only option left is to trust the claim made by the collectors that the data they are providing is authentic. This project resolves the trust issue by creating a distributed application using blockchains by distributing the trust factor to the entire network instead of trusting a single entity [5]. This system provides authenticity of data generated by sensor nodes in the network. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Over the past decade, a lot of evolution has happened in the field of security specifically authentication system. The most commonly used authentication service we use now is OAuth 2.0 based authentication. In this method, we are dependent on a 3rd party authentication service provider to which we need to trust. Though this model is used extensively nowadays, studies show that it is still vulnerable to several hacks. In addition to that, the 3rd party authentication provider has total control over the user data to which they can leak or modify at their will. Thus the use of OAuth 2.0 based protocol has raised security and privacy concerns. In this paper, blockchain and its use cases are studied and an alternative way of authentication service has been proposed based on Ethereum Blockchain called DAuth. Furthermore, a prototype has been developed which enables user authentication on the site. DAuth proposes to enhance transparency and user control in transactions which involves identity management. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Due to emerging disruptive technologies, Internet of Things (IoT) play a vital role for smart living domains, for examples, elderly and disabilities healthcare services and home safety and security monitoring and automation control services. These systems will send automatically an emergency call with home user information and location as a privacy data to public services like hospitals, police offices, or fire departments. This paper introduces emergency service for a Smart Home System (SHS) based on Ethereum blockchain with smart contract for decentralized handling access control among untrusted public services so called Home Service Providers (HSPs) and smart home IoT devices. Our SHS testbed consists of (1) smart home sensor manger equipped with Raspberry Pi (RPi) represented as an edge IoT gateway for gathering environmental sensor data, (2) HSP miners deployed Meteor and Ethereum platform, and (3) web-based applications for home users and HSP staffs. Furthermore, our contribution includes the integration of digital signature for the IoT device authentication, the One Time Passcode with QR code for HSP staff access control, and IPFS for manipulating emergency call from SHS in peers. Our implementation results focusing on HSP miners will be presented and analysed. © 2019 IEEE.},

abstract={Recent proliferation in disruptive technologies has opened up a new horizon for Internet of Vehicles (IoV). The success of IoV highly depends on the robustness of vehicular information system as a dispute among the service providers on data rights or any kind of security violation could disrupt the transport services altogether. In this work we propose a blockchain based novel architecture for vehicle authentication and privacy preservation with seamless access control for IoV. Proposed architecture is decentralized, robust and scalable. Along with privacy preserving authentication and conflict-free access-log maintenance, the proposed BlockAPP protocol also supports an optional traceability feature. Performance evaluation using smart contact over Ethereum Blockchain validates the effectiveness of the proposed architecture. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={These days, IoT devices are deployed at a massive scale, with Cisco predicting 20 billion devices by the year 2020. As opposed to endpoint devices, IoT devices are resource-constrained devices, incapable of securing and defending themselves, and can be easily hacked and compromised. Fog computing can augment such capacity limitations by providing localized compute, storage, and networking for a group of IoT devices. As fog nodes are deployed in close proximity to IoT devices, fog computing can be more effective than cloud computing. Furthermore, Blockchain has emerged as technology with capabilities to provide secure management, authentication and access to IoT devices and their data, in decentralized manner with high trust, integrity, and resiliency. In this paper, we propose a user authentication scheme using blockhain-enabled fog nodes in which fog nodes interface to Ethereum smart contracts to authenticate users to access IoT devices. The fog nodes are used to provide scalability to the system by relieving the IoT devices from carrying out heavy computation involving tasks related to authentication and communicating with the blockchain. We describe system components, architecture and design, and we discuss key aspects related to security analysis, functionality, testing and implementation of the smart contracts. The full code of the smart contracts for authentication registry, lists, rules and logic is also made publicly available at Github. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Recently, blockchain has been foreseen by industry and research community as a transformational and disruptive technology that is poised to play a major role in transforming the way we transact, trade, bank, track and register assets, and do business. Blockchain can potentially be used to provide trusted authenticity, origin, and ownership for IoT devices, in a way that is secure and decentralized without the involvement of a Trusted Third Parties (TTP) or centralized authorities and services. A TTP can be a subject to a single point of failure, and it can be disrupted, compromised or hacked. A TTP can potentially misbehave and become corrupt in the future, even if it is trustworthy now. This paper shows how Ethereum blockchain (with the powerful feature of programmability through smart contracts) can provide a trusted ownership management for medical IoT (MIoT) devices. Tracking the true ownership of MIoT devices is of a paramount importance as using counterfeited MIoT devices can be life-threatening to patients. The paper presents a general framework and solution to manage and trace back the true origin of ownership for an MIoT; whereby an MIoT device can be owned by multiple parties during its life cycle. The paper presents a detailed overview of our proposed system architecture, design, entity relationship, and interactions among all involved parties. The source code of the Ethereum smart contracts is made publicly available. Key aspects related to the algorithms, interactions, implementation and testing are discussed in the paper. Furthermore, we provide security analysis of our proposed solution in terms of satisfying the general security goals and also resiliency against popular attacks as those of DDoS, eavesdropping and replay attacks. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={In centralized environments, the results of voting events have always been questionable and perceived differently by voters. Most existing E-Voting systems are based on centralized servers where the voters must trust the organizing authority for the integrity of the results. In this paper we propose a novel approach for a decentralized trustless voting platform that relies on Blockchain technology to solve the trust issues. The main features of this system include ensuring data integrity and transparency, and enforcing one vote per mobile phone number for every poll with ensured privacy. To accomplish this, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is used as the Blockchain runtime environment, on which transparent, consistent and deterministic smart contracts will be deployed by organizers for each voting event to run the voting rules. Users are authenticated through their mobile phone numbers without the need of a third party server. Results showed that the system is feasible and may offer a step towards ideal environments for such experience. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Medical care has become one of the most indispensable parts of human lives, leading to a dramatic increase in medical big data. To streamline the diagnosis and treatment process, healthcare professionals are now adopting Internet of Things (IoT)-based wearable technology. Recent years have witnessed billions of sensors, devices, and vehicles being connected through the Internet. One such technology—remote patient monitoring—is common nowadays for the treatment and care of patients. However, these technologies also pose grave privacy risks and security concerns about the data transfer and the logging of data transactions. These security and privacy problems of medical data could result from a delay in treatment progress, even endangering the patient’s life. We propose the use of a blockchain to provide secure management and analysis of healthcare big data. However, blockchains are computationally expensive, demand high bandwidth and extra computational power, and are therefore not completely suitable for most resource-constrained IoT devices meant for smart cities. In this work, we try to resolve the above-mentioned issues of using blockchain with IoT devices. We propose a novel framework of modified blockchain models suitable for IoT devices that rely on their distributed nature and other additional privacy and security properties of the network. These additional privacy and security properties in our model are based on advanced cryptographic primitives. The solutions given here make IoT application data and transactions more secure and anonymous over a blockchain-based network. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Blockchain is one of the most revolutionary and innovative technologies in recent years. The traditional asymmetric encryption algorithms guarantee the security of data on blockchain. However, with the rapid development of quantum computing technologies, as long as large-scale quantum computers appear, these kind of encryption systems can be deciphered by shor algorithm in polynomial time. Therefore, blockchain technologies are going to face potential security threats. To solve this problem, the best solution at present is to replace the asymmetric encryption algorithms in the blockchain with post-quantum cryptosystems. In this paper, we apply the Rainbow algorithm with high signature efficiency to the existing Ethereum platform, and test the feasibility of the scheme by building a private chain. In addition, we compare the signature efficiency of Rainbow algorithm with ECDSA, which is expected to provide direction and inspiration for future research on blockchain resistance to quantum computing. © 2019, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.},

abstract={Ride-hailing services have experienced remarkable development throughout the world, serving millions of users per day. However, service providers, such as Uber and Didi, operate independently. If they are willing to share user data and establish collaborative-rides (c-rides), more ride services and commercial interests will be produced. Meanwhile, these collaborations raise significant security and privacy concerns for both users and service providers, because users’ sensitive information and service providers’ business secrets could be leaked during c-rides. Moreover, data auditability and fairness must be guaranteed. In this paper, we propose CoRide: a privacy-preserving Collaborative-Ride hailing service using blockchain-assisted vehicular fog computing. First, we anonymously authenticate users and disclose a targeted user only if all collaborative service providers are present while requiring no trusted authority. Then, we construct a consortium blockchain to record c-rides and create smart contracts to pair riders with drivers. Private proximity test and query processing are utilized to support location authentication, driver screening and destination matching. Last, we modify Zerocash to achieve anonymous payment and defend double spending attacks. Finally, we analyze the security of CoRide and demonstrate its efficiency through extensive experiments based on an Ethereum network. © ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2019.},

abstract={Ethereum is a popular Blockchain platform that allows users to manage their cryptocurrency transactions through the wallets. Ethereum wallet helps interact with the blockchain network easily, and it keeps Ethereum cryptocurrency (Ether) transaction data of its users. The use of Ethereum and wallets grows rapidly. Since they handle huge value of crypto assets, attackers are keen to hack and steal Ethers from Ethereum wallets. But there lacks comprehensive security analysis, especially on keystore files in Ethereum wallets. There were a few incidents occurred with huge loss of Ethers in Etheruem wallets within the last five years. In this paper, we conducted a systematic analysis on hacking methods from the existing literature and conducted experiments to find how the Ethereum wallet’s keystore file is vulnerable to the adversaries. Since the keystore file is secured with a password, we have used the brute-force and the dictionary attack to crack the password of the keystore file in Ethereum wallets. Our results showed that the dictionary attack is more efficient to hack the keystore file than the brute-force attack. Further, the keystore file is less vulnerable, if it is used complex password credentials. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.},

abstract={The developments of cryptocurrencies push central banks of many countries to consider their own digital fiat currencies. As banks are usually taken as a trusted third party, it is unnecessary to rebuild a blockchain system to rebuild trust. However, cryptocurrencies provide many interesting features except the basic financial functions. It is naturally to absorb the interesting parts of cryptocurrencies to the centralized bank system. We here extract a stateful authentication mechanism from the practice of Ethereum and show how to run puzzle and payment channel templates in a centralized system, based on which we may build a fiat currency lighting network to support direct exchanges of users. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Blockchain protocols for cryptocurrencies offer secure payment transactions, yet their throughput pales in comparison to centralized payment systems such as VISA. Moreover, transactions incur fees that relatively hinder the adoption of cryptocurrencies for simple daily payments. Micropayment channels are second layer protocols that allow efficient and nearly unlimited number of payments between parties at the cost of only two transactions, one to initiate it and the other one to close it. Typically, the de-facto approach for micropayment channels on Ethereum is to utilize digital signatures which incur a constant gas cost but still relatively high due to expensive elliptic curve operations. Recently, ElSheikh et al. have proposed a protocol that utilizes hash chain which scales linearly with the channel capacity and has a lower cost compared to the digital signature based channel up to a capacity of 1000 micropayments. In this paper, we improve even more and propose a protocol that scales logarithmically with the channel capacity. Furthermore, by utilizing a variant of Merkle tree, our protocol does not require the payer to lock the entire balance at the channel creation which is an intrinsic limitation with the current alternatives. To assess the efficiency of our protocol, we carried out a number of experiments, and the results prove a positive efficiency and an overall low cost. Finally, we release the source code for prototype on Github (https://github.com/HSG88/Payment-Channel). © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.},

abstract={In cloud system, user identity authentication is a key problem. If design defects persist in a cloud user identity authentication scheme, direct risks of sensitive data loss and severe information breach will be incurred. At present, the main problem of cloud user identity management system is that it relies too much on third-party services. Although some third-party-detachment schemes have been proposed in recent years, most of them still rely heavily on cloud server-centered design system. In this paper, a cloud user identity management protocol based on ethereum blockchain was proposed, followed by an establishment of a simple credit management system framework. The new protocol is an improved version of CIDM (Consolidated Identity Management) referred to as EIDM (Ethrerum-based Identity Management) protocol. In the improved protocol, JWT (JSON Web Token) in OAuth 2.0 was used to introduce smart contracts into EIDM protocol, and the credit management system was added to the system so that it can provide a credible identity authentication protocol for cloud users and service providers. The new protocol solves the problem of over-reliance on third parties in the existing identity management system solutions. In the end, an analysis on the security of the new protocol showed that the EIDM protocol proposed in this paper presents more diversified security guarantees relative to the CIDM protocol. The performance evaluation results also indicated that the new protocol demonstrates better practicability and flexibility. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={—This paper introduces FileTribe, a secure decentralized application for sharing files in closed groups. It employs IPFS, a distributed file system, as its data storage layer, avoiding the pitfalls of centralized storage solutions. Changes to files and group membership are recorded separately on a blockchain, making them irrefutable. A Decentralized Application (Dapp) on top of Ethereum is responsible for user authentication and reaching consensus among group members regarding the state of the group and shared files. File access control is supervised by the members themselves. These features combine to make FileTribe unique in its ability to serve a wide range of safety-critical scenarios, including ones where cloud-based or pure peer-to-peer solutions fall short. © VDE VERLAG GMBH.},

abstract={A new emerging trend concerns the implementation of services and distributed applications through the blockchain technology. A blockchain is an append-only database, which guarantees security, transparency and immutability of records. Blockchains can be used in the field of Cultural Heritage to protect minor artworks, i.e. artistic relevant works not as famous as masterpieces. Minor artworks are subjected to counterfeiting, thefts and natural disasters because they are not well protected as famous artworks. This paper describes a blockchain-based application, called MApp (Minor Artworks application), which lets authenticated users (private people or organizations), store the information about their artworks in a secure way. The use of blockchain produces three main advantages. Firstly, artworks cannot be deleted from the register thus preventing thieves to remove records associated stolen objects. Secondly, artworks can be added and updated only by authorized users, thus preventing counterfeiting in objects descriptions. Finally, records can be used to keep artworks memory in case of destruction caused by a natural disaster. Copyright © 2019 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

abstract={With the development of technology, more and more data have been accumulated. Utilization of data can benefit many applications, such as facilitate human daily life, promote scientific research, and expedite event detection etc. How to share data within a certain group or a specific person securely and effectively has become a hot research topic. Meanwhile, many distributed technologies have appeared with the triggering of many centralized cloud web services. Thus, we propose a block-chain based data sharing framework with IPFS (https://ipfs.io/), Ethereum (https://www.ethereum.org/) and uPort (https://www.uport.me/). As a result of this design, the system could store data in IPFS system and control sensitive data by block-chain, and the authentication can be managed by the uPort ID system. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness by a case study. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

abstract={Smart contracts are applications that are deployed and executed on a blockchain's decentralised infrastructure. Many smart contract applications rely on data that resides outside the blockchain. However, while traditional web applications can communicate with trustworthy data sources directly through the Internet, this is not possible for smart contracts because their execution must be deterministic. Bringing external data into the blockchain has been a topic of research since the first introduction of Ethereum. A system that can provide this data to smart contracts is called an oracle. The primary requirement in designing oracles is that the authenticity of the data must be publicly verifiable, which can be achieved through signatures. However, transmitting data to the blockchain and performing the verification is costly, especially if applications require data from multiple sources. In that case, current approaches would need to retrieve the data from each source separately. In this paper, we present the concept of MUlti-Source oraCLE (MUSCLE) for retrieving data from multiple sources, which we believe to be the first to focus on the multi-source scenario. We implement five variants of MUSCLE, each using a different signature or aggregate signature scheme and compare their performance with two oracles that are based on TLS-N, which represents the current state of the art. Our results show that the ECDSA-based MUSCLE features the lowest total gas expenditure, while the BGLS-based oracle provides lower transaction and storage costs. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.},

abstract={The blockchain technique was first proposed called Bitcoin in 2008 and is a distributed database technology. Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) system, which is one of the key management systems, is a centralized system. There is a possibility of single point failure in currently used centralized PKI system. Classical digital signature algorithm; ECDSA has used the well-known cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Using the Shor's algorithm, it is vulnerable to an attack by the quantum adversary. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based key management system using quantum-resistant cryptography. Since it uses a GLP digital signature scheme, which is a secure lattice-based digital signature scheme. Therefore, our construction is based on quantum-resistant cryptography, it is secure against the attack of a quantum adversary and ensures long-term safety. In addition, we design a decentralized blockchain structure with extended X.509 certificate, and it is secure for the single point of failure. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.},

abstract={Nowadays public key infrastructure authentication mainly rely on certificate authorities and have to be trusted by both domain operators and domain owners. Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) using DNS-based Authentication Name Entities (DANE) DNS records types, offer additional security for authenticating data and integrity to domain name system (DNS). This method allow client via signed statements to specify which CAs are authorized to represent certificate of a domain. Another method is Certificate Authority Authorizations (CAA) developed by Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) to provide security guarantee against rogue certificate authorities that offer fake certificate for the domain. However, all of these approaches are prone to single point of failure due to their trust attached to infrastructure like Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). In order to weaken the level of trust to the CAs over certificates, it is necessary to balance the distribution rights among the entities and improve the control of certificate issuance for the certificate owners. Recently with the emergence of Blockchain, a public and distributed ledger, several applications appeared taking advantage of this powerful technology. In this paper, we present an AuthLedger a domain authentication scheme based on blockchain technology. The proposed scheme is multi-fold. First, we proposed a domain authentication scheme to reduce the level of trust in CAs. second, we implement our system using Ethereum smart contract. Third, we evaluate security and performance of the proposed system. © 2019 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.},

abstract={The service of mutual legal assistance documents through electronic delivery is prohibited by the formal diplomatic approach and not approved by many conventions and regulations in sending documents from one country to another over the past few years. In the Internet of Things world, the service through electronic delivery is indispensible and convenience. Under the ideas, I want to research the related issues about the service of mutual legal assistance documents through electronic delivery to provide the legitimate and the feasibility. Council Regulation (EC) No 1393/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 November 2007 had amended and repealed the Council Regulation (EC) No 1348/2000 on the service in the Member States of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters (service of documents). Expanding electronic service for delivery judicial or extra-judicial documents for every country will be popular in the future. I boldly proposed in this article that the electronic delivery judicial or extra-judicial documents of mutual assistant in civil and commercial matters through the Blockchain method and take advantage of the Digital signature produced by Ethereum, or similar to this way, providing a digital signature as a reference to protect privacy and to be as the security protection. Furthermore, this article introduces all of the defects of the electronic service will be improved if the delivery sends on the Blockchain. © 2019, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.},

abstract={Nowadays, numerous applications of smart home systems provide recommendations for users, including reducing their energy consumption, warnings of defective devices, selecting reliable devices and software, diagnoses, etc [1]. The internet connected, dynamic and heterogeneous nature of the smart home environment creates new security, authentication, and privacy challenges [2]. To solve those challenges, an approach to data privacy in smart home using blockchain technology, which is called smart home based the IoT-Blockchain (SHIB), is proposed in this paper. In order to demonstrate the proposed architecture, an experimental scenario using Ganache, Remix, and web3. js is built among the user, service provider, and smart home to evaluate the performance of the smart contract in the SHIB. Based on the experiment results, the SHIB architecture brings the advantages like data privacy, trust access control, and high extension ability. In addition, the comparison between the proposed architecture and existing models in different parameters such as smart contract, the privacy of data, usage of tokens, updating the policies, and misbehavior judging are performed. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={IoT is leading a digital revolution in both academia and industry. It brings convenience to people's daily lives; however, the issues of security and privacy of IoT become challenges. Blockchain, a decentralized database based on cryptographic techniques, is promising for IoT security, which may influence a variety of areas including manufacture, finance, and trading. The blockchain framework in an IoT system is an intriguing alternative to the traditional centralized model, which is struggling to meet some specified demands in IoT. In this article, we investigate typical security and privacy issues in IoT and develop a framework to integrate blockchain with IoT, which can provide great assurance for IoT data and various functionalities and desirable scalability including authentication, decentralized payment, and so on. We also suggest some possible solutions to these security and privacy issues in IoT based on blockchain and Ethereum to show how blockchain contributes to IoT. © 2002-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={BlAsT is an efficient scheme for achieving certification of data continuity through a history attached to a public blockchain. The scheme guarantees the properties of linearity, non-equivocation, time-stamping and transparency. We discuss the implementation of BlAsT over the Bitcoin and the Ethereum blokchains, provide a techno-economic analysis to evaluate the costs related to blockchain adoption, and numerically assess the performance of the proposed architecture in terms of storage and bandwidth requirements. Results show that the above properties can be guaranteed with a small cryptocurrency payment. The proposed scheme can be used for IoT devices under the assumption that the device is able to either perform blockchain validation or delegate it to a trusted node. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Without the design for inherent security, the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is vulnerable to prefix/subprefix hijacks and other attacks. Though many BGP security approaches have been proposed to prevent or detect such attacks, the unsatisfactory cost-effectiveness frustrates their deployment. In fact, the currently deployed BGP security infrastructure leaves the chance for potential centralized authority misconfiguration and abuse. It actually becomes the critical yield point that demands the logging and auditing of misbehaviors and attacks in BGP security deployments. We propose a blockchain-based Internet number resource authority and trustworthy management solution, named BGPcoin, to facilitate the transparency of BGP security. BGPcoin provides a reliable origin advertisement source for origin authentication by dispensing resource allocations and revocations compliantly against IP prefix hijacking. We perform and audit resource assignments on the tamper-resistant Ethereum blockchain by means of a set of smart contracts, which also interact as one to provide the trustworthy origin route examination for BGP. Compared with RPKI, BGPcoin yields significant benefits in securing origin advertisement and building a dependable infrastructure for the object repository. We demonstrate it through an Ethereum prototype implementation, and we deploy it and do experiment on a locally-simulated network and an official Ethereum test network respectively. The extensive experiment and evaluation demonstrate the incentives to deploy BGPcoin, and the enhanced security provided by BGPcoin is technically and economically feasible. © 2018 by the authors.},

abstract={The H2020 European research project Safe-Guarding Home IoT Environments with Personalised Real-time Risk Control (GHOST) aims to develop a cyber-security layer on IoT smart home installations. The proposed system analyses packet-level data flows for building patterns of communications between IoT devices and external entities. To ensure non-repudiation, integrity and authentication of the data captured, they are stored in a Blockchain, a distributed ledger network, as digitally-signed transactions. Since the data can potentially include sensitive user information, it is imperative to promote trust by informing users about the operating principles of the network as well as to request the acceptance of a consent form by them. This paper presents the design and implementation of a Forms of Consent application, a Distributed Application that interacts with a set of Smart Contracts deployed on a private Ethereum network. The application is being developed as part of the GHOST project. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={While blockchains and smart contracts are primarily known for their use as the technologies underlying cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum, these technologies also have applicability in other areas. In this paper, we present an application of smart contracts running on a permissioned distributed ledger (essentially a private blockchain where only credentialed participants are allowed to read and write) to managing tenant and service accounts in a cloud computing data center. The system is called Saranyu and it supports four services: identity management, authentication, authorization, and charging. Identity management and authentication are handled using client-generated public/private key pairs in the usual fashion. Authorization is handled as a contract from a grantee of service access rights to a recipient which is a tenant or other service. Charging is supported by Saranyu integration with payment gateways for payments related to service resource usage. We describe an implementation of Saranyu on top of the Quorum blockchain system. We believe the security, non-repudiation, tamper-resistance, and easy transaction history access brought by blockchain technology will increase transparency and trust in cloud tenant and service management and that the fundamentally distributed nature of the blockchain will make Saranyu an excellent match with developing distributed cloud architectures. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={While blockchain services hold great promise to improve many different industries, there are significant cybersecurity concerns which must be addressed. In this paper, we investigate security considerations for an Ethereum blockchain hosting a distributed energy management application. We have simulated a microgrid with ten buildings in the northeast U.S., and results of the transaction distribution and electricity utilization are presented. We also present the effects on energy distribution when one or two smart meters have their identities corrupted. We then propose a new approach to digital identity management that would require smart meters to authenticate with the blockchain ledger and mitigate identity-spoofing attacks. Applications of this approach to defense against port scans and DDoS, attacks are also discussed. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={There is no doubt that Internet of Things (IoT) occupy a very important role in our daily lives. Indeed, numerous objects that we use every time, are being equipped with electronic devices and protocol suites in order to make them interconnected and connected to the Internet. In IoT, things process and exchange data without human intervention. Therefore, because of this full autonomy, these entities need to recognize and authenticate each other as well as to ensure the integrity of their exchanged data. Otherwise, they will be the target of malicious users and malicious use. Due to the size and other features of IoT, it is almost impossible to create an efficient centralized authentication system. To remedy this limit, in this paper, we propose an original decentralized system called bubbles of trust, which ensures a robust identification and authentication of devices. Furthermore, it protects the data integrity and availability. To achieve such a goal, our approach relies on the security advantages provided by blockchains, and serves to create secure virtual zones (bubbles) where things can identify and trust each other. We also provided a real implementation of our mechanism using the C++ language and Ethereum blockchain. The obtained results prove its ability to satisfy IoT security requirements, its efficiency, and its low cost. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={We design and implement the first private and anonymous decentralized crowdsourcing system ZebraLancer, and overcome two fundamental challenges of decentralizing crowdsourcing, i.e. data leakage and identity breach. First, our outsource-then-prove methodology resolves the tension between blockchain transparency and data confidentiality, which is critical in crowdsourcing use-case. ZebraLancer ensures: (i) a requester will not pay more than what data deserve, according to a policy announced when her task is published via the blockchain; (ii) each worker indeed gets a payment based on the policy, if he submits data to the blockchain; (iii) the above properties are realized not only without a central arbiter, but also without leaking the data to the open blockchain. Furthermore, the transparency of blockchain allows one to infer private information about workers and requesters through their participation history. On the other hand, allowing anonymity will enable a malicious worker to submit multiple times to reap rewards. ZebraLancer overcomes this problem by allowing anonymous requests/submissions without sacrificing the accountability. The idea behind is a subtle linkability: if a worker submits twice to a task, anyone can link the submissions, or else he stays anonymous and unlinkable across tasks. To realize this delicate linkability, we put forward a novel cryptographic concept, i.e. the common-prefix-linkable anonymous authentication. We remark the new anonymous authentication scheme might be of independent interest. Finally, we implement our protocol for a common image annotation task and deploy it in a test net of Ethereum. The experiment results show the applicability of our protocol with the existing real-world blockchain. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Insurances are a way of financial risk mitigation that pay the user in case of damage. However, once the event happens, the user does not get paid immediately due to the large degree of human interaction required. In this paper, we automate insurance payment by using smart contracts. As additional contribution, our design supports integration of IoT devices to register events that trigger insurance contracts and offers additional privacy-protection even on public blockchains. In order to allow users to retrieve their payment from the insurance contract anonymously we remove the linkability and traceability between events that triggers the contract and the insurance holder by applying ring signatures. Using a prototypical implementation based on Ethereum, we study the additional overhead and cost that our design incurs and can show that exploiting latest features of Ethereum, gas cost can be driven down substantially compared to earlier approaches. In sum, we propose, implement, and evaluate a design for smart insurance contracts integrating IoT sensors and including additional privacy protection using ring signatures. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Public key distribution and device authentication remain the main security challenges in many systems and applications. Existing solutions are based on Public Key Infrastructures (PKI) backed by Certificate Authorities (CA) to validate the authenticity of the devices. However, distributing and provisioning certificates for each client showed to be impractical especially for Internet of Things (IoT) devices. In this paper we propose a distributed PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) platform based on the Ethereum Blockchain. It contains a decentralized key-store that holds the public keys of all devices, and includes a generic protocol for PSK (Pre-Shared Keys) distribution. PSK keys can then be used by PSK-based security protocols (TLS-PSK, DTLS-PSK, SRTP..) for securing the communication channel between two devices. This platform includes a client-side module, a public key management module configured on the server, and a smart contract software deployed on the Ethereum Blockchain network. This generic platform can be used by many applications for client and server authentication, data integrity, and secure peer to peer communications. Moreover, this promising system may potentially eliminate the trust requirement imposed by the existing PKI/CAs infrastructure on clients. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={Internet of Things becomes a major part of our lives, billions of autonomous devices are connected and communicate with each other. This revolutionary paradigm creates a new dimension that removes the boundaries between the real and the virtual worlds. The Wireless Sensor Networks are a masterpiece of the success of this technology, using limited capacity sensors and actuators, industrial, medical, agricultural and many other environments can be covered and managed automatically. This autonomous interacting things should authenticate each other, and communicate securely. Otherwise malicious users can cause serious damages on such systems. In this paper we propose a robust, transparent, flexible and energy efficient blockchain-based authentication mechanism called BCTrust, which is designed especially for devices with computational, storage and energy consumption constraints. In order to evaluate our approach, we realized a real implementation with C programming language, and Ethereum Blockchain. © 2018 IEEE.},

abstract={An enormous growth in data centric partnerships and collaborations has given rise to trust and transparency issues within information sharing ecosystems. Blockchain offers a decentralized computing environment and an append-only, immutable, and replicated data store that is kept in consensus by all participating systems. Ethereum is a platform based on the blockchain technology that also allows code, which can be executed and can interact with the internally stored data, to reside on the blockchain. We investigate the use of Ethereum for a data sharing solution that includes access control and authentication. We examine architectural alternatives and build a proof of concept for the selected alternative in order to explore how to adopt and adapt the inherent trust and transparency of blockchain into the data sharing solution that includes access control and authentication. © ISCA 2018.},

abstract={The events of 2016 in which the painter Peter Doig (b. 1959) was sued in US Federal Court for failing to authenticate an artwork for a speculative investor encapsulate a view of the art world from the perspective of collectors and not artists. This paper imagines what would happen if artists were to retain 10% equity in their work in the primary market, rather than receive resale royalties in the secondary market. This idea applies the Coase Theorem in economics, concerning the relationship of property rights, pricing, and trade. Accordingly, those equity shares could trade in a standalone marketplace well before an artwork was sold, providing patronage for artists and more diversifiable art fund structures for investors. Technological systems such as the blockchain (e.g. bitcoin) make such a system timely, by providing cheap accounting and automatic provenance. This proposal stands in stark contrast to much of the writing on resale royalties, which treats payments to artists as welfare or subsidy, or emphasizes a lack of enforceability. In fact, assigning equity shares to artists allows them to participate more accurately, from a free-market-economics standpoint, in the value that their work creates. This realignment of price and value could radically alter and also stabilize the art market in relation to both recent financial crises and the increasing financialization of art objects. Such a system has broad applications to the alignment of price and value in many other sectors of creative work, and beyond. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={The role-based access control (RBAC) framework is a mechanism that describes the access control principle. As a common interaction, an organization provides a service to a user who owns a certain role that was issued by a different organization. Such trans-organizational RBAC is common in face-to-face communication but not in a computer network, because it is difficult to establish both the security that prohibits the malicious impersonation of roles and the flexibility that allows small organizations to participate and users to fully control their own roles. In this paper, we present an RBAC using smart contract (RBAC-SC), a platform that makes use of Ethereum's smart contract technology to realize a trans-organizational utilization of roles. Ethereum is an open blockchain platform that is designed to be secure, adaptable, and flexible. It pioneered smart contracts, which are decentralized applications that serve as 'autonomous agents' running exactly as programmed and are deployed on a blockchain. The RBAC-SC uses smart contracts and blockchain technology as versatile infrastructures to represent the trust and endorsement relationship that are essential in the RBAC and to realize a challenge-response authentication protocol that verifies a user's ownership of roles. We describe the RBAC-SC framework, which is composed of two main parts, namely, the smart contract and the challenge-response protocol, and present a performance analysis. A prototype of the smart contract is created and deployed on Ethereum's Testnet blockchain, and the source code is publicly available. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Ethereum provides authenticated storage: each read returns a value and a proof that allows the client to verify the value returned is correct. We experimentally show that such authentication leads to high read and write amplification (64× in the worst case). We present a novel data structure, Merkelized LSM (mLSM), that significantly reduces the read and write amplification while still allowing client verification of reads. mLSM significantly increases the performance of the storage subsystem in Ethereum, thereby increasing the performance of a wide range of Ethereum applications. © USENIX Workshop on Hot Topics in Storage and File Systems, HotStorage 2018, co-located with USENIX ATC 2018.All right reserved.},

abstract={Recent years have witnessed the trend of increasingly relying on remote and distributed infrastructures. This increased the number of reported incidents of security and privacy breaches, mainly due to the loss of data control. Towards these challenges, we propose a new access control scheme based on emerging blockchain infrastructures. Our approach relies on the use of smart auditable contracts deployed in blockchain infrastructures. Thus, it offers transparent and controlled access to outsourced data, such that malicious entities cannot process data without data owners’ authorization. In fact, the effectiveness of the authentication relies on the blockchain intrinsic properties. Moreover, an implementation of the proposed solution based on Ethereum Blockchain is presented to show the applicability of our scheme in real-world scenarios.

abstract={AC (Access Control) is the process of ensuring that an authenticated user accesses only what he or she is authorized to do with respect to certain models and security policies. In business collaboration systems, services are designed to conduct actions requested by a customer, using service provider’s infrastructure. In such context, the agreement on a conventional access management system is difficult because it will depend on different infrastructures and security policies implemented by each involved party. In this paper, we investigate the authorization process that manages permissions and rights of access to shared services in a federation of enterprises and we propose a solution based on the Ethereum Blockchain platform and the Attribute Based Access Control Model (ABAC) to define this authorization process. © 2018 CEUR-WS.

abstract={Despite technological advances, most smart objects in the Internet of Things (IoT) cannot be accessed using technologies designed and developed for interacting with powerful Internet servers. IoT use cases involve devices that not only have limited resources, but also they are not always connected to the Internet and are physically exposed to tampering. In this paper, we describe the design, development, and evaluation of a smart contract-based solution that allows end-users to securely interact with smart devices. Our approach enables access control, Thing authentication, and payments in a fully decentralized setting, taking at the same time into consideration the limitations and constraints imposed by both blockchain technologies and the IoT paradigm. Our prototype implementation is based on existing technologies, i.e., Ethereum smart contracts, which makes it realistic and fundamentally secure. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.},

abstract={The Internet today lacks an identity protocol for identifying people and organizations. As a result, service providers needed to build and maintain their own databases of user information. This solution is costly to the service providers, inefficient as much of the information is duplicated across different providers, difficult to secure as evidenced by recent large-scale personal data breaches around the world, and cumbersome to the users who need to remember different sets of credentials for different services. Furthermore, personal information could be collected for data mining, profiling and exploitation without users' knowledge or consent. The ideal solution would be self-sovereign identity, a new form of identity management that is owned and controlled entirely by each individual user. This solution would include the individual's consolidated digital identity as well as their set of verified attributes that have been cryptographically signed by various trusted issuers. The individual provides proof of identity and membership by sharing relevant parts of their identity with the service providers. Consent for access may also be revoked hence giving the individual full control over its own data. This survey critically investigates different blockchain based identity management and authentication frameworks. A summary of the state-of-the-art blockchain based identity management and authentication solutions from year 2014 to 2018 is presented. The paper concludes with the open issues, main challenges and directions highlighted for future work in this area. In a nutshell, the discovery of this new mechanism disrupted the existing identity management and authentication solutions and by providing a more promising secure platform. © 2018, Insight Society.},

abstract={Public key server is a simple yet effective way of key management in secure end-to-end communication. To ensure the trustworthiness of a public key server, CONIKS employs a tamper-evident data structure on the server and a gossiping protocol among clients in order to detect compromised servers. However, due to lack of incentive and vulnerability to malicious clients, a gossiping protocol is hard to implement in practice. Meanwhile, alternative solutions such as EthIKS are too costly. This paper presents Trusternity, an auditing scheme relying on Ethereum blockchain that is easy to implement, inexpensive to operate and resilient to malicious clients. We also conduct an empirical study of system behaviour in face of attacks and propose a lightweight anomaly detection algorithm to protect clients against such attacks. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2018.},

abstract={The Holy Quran is the fundamental Islamic scripture revealed to the Prophet Muhammad (Peace and Blessings of Allah be upon him) for the past 1400 years. In today’s Internet, there exist online sources which provide incomplete or false Quranic text which may either be published deliberately or unintentionally. The research investigates the possibility of developing a digital trust framework that secures the integrity of the Quranic text using blockchain technology. The research uses blockchain technology as the emerging secured distributed ledger to establish digital trust. The Ethereum blockchain platform was used to validate the proposed framework. The proposed digital trust framework was developed in a three-level architecture consisting of participants, digital trust and Quranic text. The key components of the proposed framework were found useful in Ethereum blockchain platform for effective use in distributed ledger, distributed consensus, smart contract, decentralized application development and cryptographic algorithms for database encryption and user authentication in Whisper, Swarm and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). The findings show the effectiveness, efficiency and usability of the proposed digital trust framework on the Ethereum blockchain platform and demonstrate how user of Quran and blockchain miner interact with the system to verify and validate Quranic content. The research has recommended the use of blockchain technology to secure the integrity of the Quranic text. The work facilitates the protection of the Quranic text as well as proving a mean to verify the authenticity of the Quranic content. © 2018 Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka. All Rights Reserved.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose a solution to provide originality and authenticity of published and posted freely online digital content such as books, music, and movies. Our solution utilizes a blend of newly emerging technologies that primary include (InterPlanetary File System) IPFS and blockchain smart contracts. IPFS is used to store digital content with a high integrity and global accessibility to all, and Ethereum smart contract is used to govern, manage, and provide traceability and visibility into the history of digital content from its origin to the latest version, in a manner that is decentralized and globally accessed with high integrity, resiliency, and transparency. In the paper, our solution is focused on online book publication, but the solution can be a framework that can be easily extendible and adoptable for, to other digital and multimedia content. The full code of our smart contract is provided, with discussion on implementation and testing of its key functionalities. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.},

abstract={Data integrity of outsourced data is main problem in CSP (cloud service provider). Space overhead and computation complexity are very high issue in recent PDP(Provable Data Possession) verification schemes. To overcome such issues MPDP (Mobile Provable Data Possession) schemes using hash tree data structure and Boneh-Lynn-Snacham short signature scheme have been used over decade. Data dynamics is well supported in MPDP scheme via block less verification, dynamic data operations, stateless verification, and verification out sourcing. But still there are some operations which can be performed much more efficiently in some other way than that of the two methods prescribed above. Operations in particular, data modification operations like insertion and deletion operations is somewhat difficult or in other words time consuming in hash tree data structure. In this paper, we have deployed an improved hash tree structure called MPT (Merkle Patricia Tree) for integrity checking.MPT is combination of MHT (Merkle Hash Tree) and patricia tree where each node consists of key-value pairs. As of now, MPT has been used only in block chain technology for providing authentication of transactions through Ethereum. © 2018 Authors.},

However, the potential risk of centralized authority abuse and the fragile infrastructure may lead a sluggish deployment of such BGP security approach currently. We propose BGPCoin, a trustworthy blockchain-based Internet resource management solution which provides compliant resource allocations and revocations, and a reliable origin advertisement source. By means of a smart contract to perform and supervise resource assignments on the tamperresistant Ethereum blockchain, BGPCoin yields signicant benets in the secure origin advertisement and the dependable infrastructure for object repository compared with RPKI. We demonstrate through an Ethereum prototype implementation that the deployment incentives and increased security are technically and economically viable. © 2017 author(s).},

abstract={Since the start of Bitcoin in 2008[1], blockchain technology emerged as the next revolutionary technology. Though blockchain started off as a core technology of Bitcoin, its use cases are expanding to many other areas including finances, Internet of Things (IoT), security and such[2]. Currently, many private and public sectors are diving into the technology[3]. Aside from that, as software and hardware improve, we would see the beginning of IoT. And those IoT devices need to communicate and synchronize with each other. But in situations where more than thousands or tens of thousands of IoT devices connected, we expect that using current model of server-client may have some limitations and issues while in synchronization. So, we propose using blockchain to build IoT system. Using blockchain, we can control and configure IoT devices. We manage keys using RSA public key cryptosystems where public keys are stored in Ethereum and private keys are saved on individual devices. Specifically, we choose Ethereum as our blockchain platform because using its smart contract, we can write our own Turing-complete code to run on top of Ethereum. Thus, we can easily manage configuration of IoT devices and build key management system. Even though we can simply use account as a key management system, which most of blockchain platform supports, we decide to use Ethereum because we can manage the system in a more fine-grained way. For the proof of a concept, we use a few IoT devices instead of a full system of IoT system, which consists of thousands of IoT devices. But in our later study, we would like to build a fully scaled IoT system using blockchain. © 2017 Global IT Research Institute - GiRI.},

abstract={Transport Layer Security (TLS) is the main standard designed for secure connections over the Internet. Security of TLS connections against active Man-in-the-Middle attacks relies on correctly validating public-key certificates during TLS handshake authentication. Although Certificate Transparency (CT) and further improved CT system—IKP mitigated the certificate authentication issues from the perspective of monitoring CA misbehavior, less attentions have been paid to consider the misbehavior of domain in using certificates during TLS handshake authentication. One misusing case is that domains refuse to use the certificates in Certificate Transparency Log for their own profits, the other is that a malicious domain impersonates the real one to deceive clients. In order to defend against domain’s misbehaviors in using certificates, we propose ETDA system based on IKP and CT aiming to enhance the security of TLS protocol from a novel perspective. ETDA is a blockchain-based system enforcing the automatic punishments in response to domain misbehavior and compensations to the client during TLS handshake authentication. The decentralized nature and incentives mechanism of ETDA provide an effective approach to prevent domains from sending invalid certificates to clients. We implement this system through Ethereum platform and Game Theory, which proved to be both technically and economically feasible. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},
